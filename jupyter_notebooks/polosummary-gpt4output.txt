The study, published in The Journal of Cell Biology, investigates the role of the Drosophila Polo kinase in cytokinesis, particularly in spermatogenesis. The research indicates that hypomorphic alleles of the Drosophila polo gene predominantly result in cytokinesis defects during spermatogenesis. These defects lead to reduced cell numbers in primary spermatocytes and the formation of multiple centrosomes. The study also found that the failure to form correct mid-zone and mid-body structures at telophase is the earliest defect during meiotic divisions. This is accompanied by incorrect localization of the Pavarotti kinesin-like protein, septin Peanut, and actin. Despite these defects, cyclin B is degraded and the cells exit M phase. The resulting spermatids are often binuclear or tetranuclear, and may also show segregation defects. The findings suggest that Polo-like kinases have conserved functions in regulating progression through M phase, including the earliest events of cytokinesis.

The gene family has been identified as playing crucial roles in several stages of mitosis in various eukaryotes. A Xenopus PLK (Polo-like kinase) has been found to activate cdc25, suggesting its involvement in the positive feedback loop during p34 cdc2 activation. Anti-Polo-like kinase antibodies, when micro-injected into human cells, prevent centrosome separation, resulting in smaller centrosomes with reduced immunoreactivity to anti-tubulin antibodies. The enzyme is also suggested to activate the anaphase-promoting complex (APC) in budding yeast and vertebrate cells. Mutations in the budding yeast gene CDC5, which encodes a Polo-like kinase, result in a late mitotic arrest.

The study investigates the role of Polo-like kinase gene plo1 in fission yeast. Disruption of plo1 results in the formation of monopolar spindles due to failure of spindle pole bodies to separate, and a failure to form an actin ring or septum before cytokinesis. Overexpression of plo1 leads to the formation of multiple septa, indicating the enzyme's potential to overcome the dependence of this process on the completion of mitosis. While no direct evidence supports a role for Polo-like kinases in cytokinesis in animal cells, their subcellular distribution suggests this possibility. Mutations in pavarotti, the gene encoding Pav-KLP, result in abnormal morphology of the central spindle and a failure of cytokinesis. The study also re-examines the meiotic phenotype, showing that in addition to defects in spindle pole behavior and chromosome non-disjunction, failure of cytokinesis can be seen throughout spermatogenesis. The findings suggest a unifying role for the Polo-like kinases in eukaryotic cells.

The study used various primary antibodies at different dilutions for immunostaining. DNA was visualized with propidium iodide, Hoechst 33258, or TOTO-3 iodide. Fluorescence microscopy was performed on testes from pharate adults or young flies using either the methanol/acetone fixation method or the ethanol/formaldehyde fixation method. Observations were made on a Leitz Aristoplan microscope or a MRC 1024 Confocal Imaging Head. Electron microscopy was also used, with testes from pupae and adult flies fixed in the trialdehyde solution. The samples were post-fixed in 1% osmium tetroxide, stained in 1% uranyl acetate, dehydrated, treated with propylene oxide, embedded in an Epon-Araldite mixture, and polymerized. The study found that polo1 mutants show different phenotypes in mitosis and meiosis, with a variety of spindle pole defects at different developmental stages. The most dramatic mitotic defects were seen in polo1-derived syncytial embryos.

The text discusses the abnormal behavior of centrosomal antigen CP190 in embryos, where it fails to associate with any microtubule-organizing centers (MTOCs). This is observed in polo 1 brains, which exhibit angled bipolar spindles and monopolar spindles, indicating improper separation of centrosomes. Cells with more than two MTOCs are rare in the polo 1 larval central nervous system. However, giant cells with multiple gamma-tubulin-containing MTOCs are commonly observed in testes from homozygous polo 1 males.

The study by Carmena et al. investigates the role of the polo gene in cytokinesis, particularly in the context of Drosophila gametogenesis. The polo mutant shows a block in centrosome duplication and separation in mitotic cells of the central nervous system, but allows multiple rounds of centrosome duplication in the male germ line. The study also reveals that ring canal formation, a crucial process in gametogenesis, is defective in polo spermatocytes. These ring canals, which are formed during incomplete cytokinesis, contain three septins, including one encoded by the gene peanut, which is essential for cytokinesis. The study also presents evidence of cytokinesis defects in pre-meiotic divisions, as indicated by reduced numbers of ring canals and enlarged cells in cysts of primary spermatocytes.

The study, published in the Journal of Cell Biology, Volume 143, 1998, discusses the normal developmental progression of spermatogenesis. The research suggests that the cell, as shown in Fig. 1, has undergone pre-meiotic cell cycles where the γ-tubulin–containing MTOCs have increased geometrically in number without cytokinesis. This cell appears to be a multinuclear cell that has entered meiosis. The study also examines cysts of primary spermatocytes, which vary in appearance from single enlarged cells to others of wild-type appearance. The study also discusses the role of cytokinesis in the formation of ring canals and the role of the kinesin-like protein encoded by pavapol01 in the process. The study also highlights spindle mid-zone defects at late anaphase in pavapol01 spermatocytes.

The study by Carmena et al. investigates the role of the polo gene in cytokinesis, specifically in the formation of the spindle mid-zone during late anaphase. The polo1 mutant was found to have fewer ring canals, indicating a failure in previous rounds of cytokinesis. The study also observed the intracellular distribution of g- and b-tubulins during cell division. In the transition into the first meiotic division, g-tubulin organizes as a compact body at the centrioles. However, in the polo1 mutant, defects were observed in the central region of the spindle during late anaphase-telophase. The study also found that many bipolar spindles failed to constrict at telophase in polo1 mutants, resulting in abnormal g-tubulin distribution. Secondary spermatocytes that failed to undergo cytokinesis in the first division entered the second meiotic cycle and underwent centrosome separation. In polo1 mutants, meiotic abnormalities were rare at metaphase of the first division, but defects were found in 31% of cells from anaphase I onwards.

The study examined the effects of the polo1 mutation on cells undergoing meiosis. Out of 1,965 meiotic figures from 20 homozygous polo1 mutant testes, 69% showed normal meiosis while 31% exhibited abnormalities from anaphase I onwards. These abnormalities were rare at the metaphase of the first division. The polo1 mutation was found to affect the relocalization of the Pav-KLP to the mid-zone of the spindle and prevent contractile ring formation. This was linked to abnormal cytokinesis. The kinesin-like protein encoded by pavarotti, which can associate with Polo kinase, was found at spindle poles until anaphase but became associated with the most central part of the spindle in the region of the cleavage. Tetrapolar cells in the polo1 mutant, where cytokinesis failed in both meiotic divisions, were also observed.

The study, published in the Journal of Cell Biology, investigates the subcellular localization of Pav-KLP and Peanut proteins in both wild-type and polo 1 mutant males during meiosis. In wild-type meiosis, Pav-KLP was difficult to visualize at the spindle poles but was observed in the cleavage furrows at telophase and in the ring canals. In contrast, in polo 1 mutant cysts, Pav-KLP was associated with the cleavage furrow of cells appearing wild-type but was not found between the telophase nuclei in cells showing mutant phenotype. The study also noted mislocalization of Pav-KLP and Peanut at telophase in polo 1 mutants. The findings suggest a disruption in the normal subcellular localization of these proteins in pavarotti mutants.

The study by Carmena et al. reveals that the polo1 mutation in Drosophila testes results in a loss of synchrony in meiotic divisions, with cells at various late meiotic stages. The mutation does not affect the association of Pav-KLP with flagellar axonemes. In wild-type cysts, Pav-KLP and the Drosophila septin Peanut colocalize in the furrow at telophase, with Pav-KLP appearing more concentrated on the inner side of the ring. In mutant cysts, both proteins tend to accumulate in larger cleavage furrow rings. The study also notes the formation of actin rings at the cleavage furrow in late meiotic cysts, with a direct link between the defect in the central spindle and a failure to establish a contractile ring. The study also suggests a potential role for Pav-KLP in transporting flagellar components or facilitating organelle elongation.

The text discusses the role of polo-like kinases in mitotic exit and cyclin destruction, which are mediated through the activation of the anaphase-promoting complex (APC). It also mentions that chromatid separation at anaphase is thought to be under the control of the APC. The study observed that anaphase could occur in polo1 mutant cells, which contradicts previous findings. The researchers then examined whether cyclin B degradation could occur in polo1 mutant testes. They found a gradient of cyclin B degradation in wild-type meiotic cysts as cells progressed. The text also describes abnormal actin ring formation during cytokinesis in polo1 mutants, which could be a result of cytokinesis failure in the first meiotic division and failure of one of the centrosomes to separate in the second division.

The study, published in the Journal of Cell Biology, investigates the role of polo kinase in the late stages of meiotic division. It was observed that cyclin B degradation occurs late in the meiotic cycle in polo 1 cells, regardless of whether they display multipolar or abnormal bipolar spindles. This suggests that polo kinase may not be necessary for activating the Anaphase-Promoting Complex (APC) to mediate cyclin B degradation, or that these processes are differentially sensitive to the polo 1 mutation. 

The research also explores the differentiation of tetranuclear spermatids resulting from a failure of cytokinesis. In the polo 1 mutants, most spermatids appear normal, but some have varying numbers of nuclei, indicating a failure of cytokinesis in one or both meiotic divisions. As these spermatids differentiate into mature sperm, the mitochondria elongate, a process that is followed by the elongation of the sperm tail. This suggests that despite the failure of cytokinesis, these cells can still undergo differentiation.

The study by Carmena et al. investigates the role of the polo gene in cytokinesis, particularly in the context of spermatogenesis. The polo1 mutant was observed to have defective axonemes and frequently contained multiple axonemes, indicating a failure of cytokinesis in one or both meiotic divisions. This was consistent with the frequency of multinucleate spermatids. The researchers confirmed that the observed cytokinesis defects were due to mutations at the polo locus by examining testes preparations from heterozygotes between polo1 and two hypomorphic mutants, polo3 and polo8. The polo1 mutation allows some cells to pass through mitosis and meiosis, but a significant proportion fail to do so, leading to defects in centrosome behavior and chromosome disjunction. Cytokinesis can fail at any developmental stage of spermatogenesis, leading to a range of abnormalities including reduced number of ring canals, enlarged and polyploid cells, and multiple centrosomes nucleating multipolar spindles. The study suggests that multiple defects can arise as a result of partial loss of polo.

The text discusses the impact of partial loss of polo function in cells, which can lead to multiple defects including cytokinesis failure and chromosome non-disjunction. This is often indicated by spermatid nuclei of varying sizes. The segregation defect may be linked to the association of polo kinase with the centromeric regions of chromosomes. The document also includes a figure and a table detailing multinuclear spermatids in polo1 and spermatid abnormalities in polo1 homozygotes, respectively. The data suggests a significant percentage of spermatids exhibit abnormalities, such as multiple nuclei or axonemes.

The study in the Journal of Cell Biology, Volume 143, 1998, suggests that defects in the organization of the central region of the spindle during anaphase may predict the failure of the contractile actin ring to form and the failure of cytokinesis in polo1 meiosis. The central spindle shows an abnormal distribution of mid-zone microtubules from late anaphase–telophase. In the polo1 mutant, a mid-body does not form and some g-tubulin remains in the mid-zone region. This g-tubulin is suggested to be required for the formation of the mid-body and the process of cytokinesis. The central spindle defects are also accompanied by a failure to correctly localize the kinesin-like protein encoded by pavarotti, a gene required for cytokinesis in developing embryos. Furthermore, rings of the septin Peanut and of actin fail to form in the mid-zone. The study also presents electron micrographs of polo1 and wild-type spermatids at sequential stages of elongation, showing abnormalities in polo1 spermatids.

The study by Carmena et al. discusses the role of Polo kinase in cytokinesis, particularly in relation to the proteins KLP3A and Pav-KLP. Mutations in these proteins result in defective spindle mid-zone formation and failure to form a mid-body, similar to other cytokinesis mutants. The proteins are thought to have a direct role in organizing the central spindle for cytokinesis. Polo kinase's association with Pav-KLP suggests it may also help localize this enzyme to the centrosomes and central spindle, aiding in the formation of the bipolar spindle and cytokinesis. The proteins appear to be mutually dependent for correct localization. The study also suggests that Polo kinase could phosphorylate other cytoskeletal components, such as septins or actin-associated proteins, to modify the structure of the contractile apparatus. This could lead to changes in the central spindle structure and cooperative interactions between the central spindle and the acto-myosin ring. The study also discusses the possibility of different demands on Polo kinase function in mitosis and meiosis, and the potential absence of checkpoint controls monitoring spindle structure during male meiotic divisions.

The b2tn mutant lacks a functional male-specific tubulin isoform, a gene highly expressed during the growth stage of primary spermatocytes. This protein is the primary g-tubulin in the microtubules of the meiotic spindle and the flagellar axoneme. Despite these mutants lacking a meiotic spindle, their chromosomes undergo normal meiotic condensation-decondensation cycles. The document also includes a schematic illustration of spermatogenesis in Drosophila, highlighting defects resulting from cytokinesis failure. The illustration uses color to represent DNA, ring canals, the fusome, microtubules, and mitochondrial derivatives.

The study establishes a significant role for Polo kinase in the early stages of cytokinesis in animal cells, similar to its role in fission yeast. Polo-like kinases appear to have a unifying role in establishing the bipolar spindle and regulating late mitotic events across species. These kinases are found associated with centrosomes and centromeres early in mitosis, and later at the spindle mid-zone and cleavage furrow before cytokinesis. The study also suggests that the spindle pole bodies could be a source for signaling molecules that regulate the onset of cytokinesis in fission yeast. In animal cells, Polo-like kinases may redistribute from the spindle poles and centromeres to the central region of the spindle, possibly an evolutionary adaptation. The association of Polo kinase with a kinesin-like protein may be necessary to regulate the change in structure of the central spindle before cytokinesis and to correctly localize Polo kinase to its site of action late in cell division. Mutations in Polo and the associated Pav-KLP lead to defects in the structure of the central spindle in late anaphase and telophase. The findings have implications for understanding the origins of the signals for cytokinesis in animal cells.

The research findings suggest a potential revision of existing models for the origins of cytokinesis signals in animal cells. Evidence from Rappaport (1961) and Wheatley and Wang (1996) suggest that the position of cytokinesis can be influenced by asters or mid-zone microtubules, respectively. Cao and Wang (1996) also found that cytokinesis could be blocked by a barrier between the central spindle and cell cortex, suggesting a signal for cytokinesis from the central spindle. These hypotheses could be reconciled if the signaling molecules, possibly Polo-like kinase, were initially localized at the poles and then at the central spindle. 

The study also discusses the distinction between late M-phase events and early cytokinesis, suggesting that defects in S. pombe plo1 disruptant and Drosophila hypomorphic polo meiotic phenotypes may not be in cytokinesis itself, but in preceding events. The study also notes differences in late mitotic phenotypes of S. pombe plo1 and its S. cerevisiae counterpart cdc5. 

The role of CDC5 in mediating late mitotic events is supported by its requirement to activate the cyclin destruction machinery. This role is further supported by findings that mouse polo-like kinase can activate components of the APC, and that the Xenopus homologue is required for mitotic exit and cyclin destruction. 

In polo1 mutant testes, despite some defects in chromosome segregation, anaphase appears to occur normally in most polo1 mutant meiocytes that fail cytokinesis. Cyclin B is degraded within these cells, suggesting that the regulation of the APC is not affected in polo1. The study concludes by noting the potential future interest in studying the behavior of components of the Drosophila.

The study by Carmena et al. discusses the role of polo in cytokinesis, a process in cell division. The research was supported by grants from the Cancer Research Campaign, BBSRC, and the European Union. The paper references multiple studies that have contributed to the understanding of the role of polo-like kinase in cell division, particularly in the G(2)/M-phase transition, the organization of the central spindle and contractile ring, and the destruction of mitotic regulators. The study also acknowledges the role of other proteins and genes in the process of cytokinesis, such as pavarotti, chickadee, and cdc5. The authors thank two anonymous referees for their constructive criticism of the paper.
