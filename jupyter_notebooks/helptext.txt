The roles are listed here:UserPI (Primary Investigator)Lab AdminLab Admin (with "view all LabGroup member’s work" permission)System AdminUserRegular users of RSpace Team and Enterprise have all the standard capabilities and permissions in RSpace: they can create and edit documents, and share them with their LabGroup. Documents created by user X are automatically viewable by the PI of the user X’s LabGroup, in addition to any other users that user X gives view and/or edit permissions.PIsPI users are in charge of LabGroups in RSpace, and as such they can view all the content created by members of their LabGroup, in addition to managing group membership and inviting new users. PI users can choose to delegate certain administrative tasks to Lab Admins. See The PI Role for more.Lab AdminsStandard LabAdminLab Admins are regular users who get appointed to admin status by their PI, giving them additional group administration capabilities. The PI may choose whether to allow admins the ability to view content created by other users in the Lab Group.LabAdmin with view permissionA Lab Admin with “view all” permission is sometimes called a “Senior Lab Admin”. By default the Senior Lab Admin has read-only access to the work of all LabGroup members, except the PI. The Senior Lab Admin can access a list of the Workspace folders of other LabGroup members by clicking the "Labgroup records" icon in the Workspace toolbar.Note that if a PI wants to make all of their work available to everyone of the lab, foregoing the usual level of confidentiality that is given to PIs, then the PI can turn on the “Autoshare” feature available on their My RSpace > My Profile page (see Open Lab Autosharing).See The Lab Admin Role for more.System AdminsFinally, System Admins are in charge of managing the specific RSpace Team or Enterprise deployment at a given institution. They can create new users (either individually or as a batch upload), create and manage LabGroups, operate as a user to help resolve issues such as resetting a user's password. See this section for more detailed information on system administration.It is important that System Admin accounts be used ONLY for System Administration tasks and NOT for adding production data. If you are both an Administrator and a contributing scientist, then you will need two different logins for those two different roles. Administrator accounts are free and do not contribute to your total number of licensed seats. Do not add production data when logged in as a SysAdmin, or Community Admin, do not add Admins to any LabGroups, and do not ever attempt to use the SysAdmin account to fill the PI or standard user role.Community AdminsCommunities are "groups of labgroups", and are useful in larger Team and Enterprise deployments for spreading the admin load of the SysAdmin. The Community admin has similar powers to a SysAdmin, but restricted to the users and groups within the Community. As such, they will not have access to the system-wide Maintenance, Configuration, and Monitoring tabs.

Use a unique, complex password.Why are verification passwords needed?SSO user sessions may persist for several hours. If you leave your computer unattended without logging out, somebody else could use your session to perform actions on your account. Some sensitive actions could result in irreversible changes, or alter how your account is accessed or managed. Therefore, RSpace prompts for additional authentication for these actions.If you login to RSpace using your SingleSignOn or Google credentials, authentication is performed by an external service and it's a best practice ro make sure that RSpace has no access to, and does not store these credentials. Essentially, RSpace does not want to know your institutional login password, so a separate password is needed any time you need to verify your identity in RSpace after your organization has already logged you in.Without the use of an internal secondary authentication mechanism, RSpace has no way to internally authenticate users who logged in using a mechanism that RSpace does not control.Verification passwords solve this problem.Security- RSpace stores these passwords using a one-way hashing algorithm with salt. This means that RSpace doesn't know, nor can reconstruct the password you set, but can validate authentication attempts.- These passwords are only functional within an existing RSpace user session and do not provide a 'backdoor' access to RSpace by-passing SSO authentication.How did we do?Related ArticlesResetting a user's password (for System Admins)My Profile and AuthenticationChangelog - what's new?(opens in a new tab)Powered by HelpDocs(opens in a new tab)×ContactSend

The public link opens the published document in another tab.You may copy a public link by clicking the 'copy' icon next to the 'public link' text. The file name as well as the link url will be copied.You may also copy the public links on the page by clicking the copy icon next to the 'copy links on this page' text above the public links table. Note that this does not copy ALL public links to your published documents. It only copies those links visible on the page.You may increase the number of rows per page using the 'items per page' drop down below the public links table.You may search for specific links, having a certain file name, belonging to a certain user or published by a specific user using the search box above the table to the right.Once unpublished, any user of the public link to the document is shown a page explaining that the document has been unpublished.If you republish a document, a new link will be generated. Anyone you previously gave the old link to will need to be sent the new link in order to see the document.See also: Managing published content, Publication of Documents and Enabling Publication of documents in your Lab GroupHow did we do?Related ArticlesManaging published contentPublication of DocumentsEnabling Publication of Documents in your Lab Group(opens in a new tab)Powered by HelpDocs(opens in a new tab)×ContactSend

The Workspace has a main toolbar for working with your documents and a table beneath to display your files and folders.The Workspace ToolbarThe toolbar buttons are focused on the main tasks you can choose to do here:a Create button to make new documents and foldersa View button to change how the files and folders are displayed (list view or tree view)a Message icon to instantly message other usersa search mechanism to search for files, documents and contenta series of filter and display buttons which can be used to change what is being displayed in the Workspace table. The filter buttons can be selected to create filtered subsets of your documents, limiting by if shared with you or if marked by you as a favourite, and can be used in conjunction with the search mechanism for more granular selections to display.a toggle button to move between a folder-based view which shows your files in a folder hierarchy and a flat view of all your files arranged simply by recency of access.Above the toolbar to the right are tabs to take you to the other main areas of the application such as The Gallery and Apps.The Workspace TableFeaturesThe main features of the Workspace listings table are as follows:Your folders, notebooks and documents appear in this table in the Workspace view. The document name is an active link to open the document.The folder view is specific for each individual – you can move documents and folders around without affecting anyone else’s view.By default, documents that you create are initially private to you and your PI.If you are a member of a group, you can share documents with that group, or RSpace Community users can share with any individuals as well as within groups. These documents will appear in the ‘Shared’ folder of other users as an alias to the original document. Learn more about collaboration here.The Shared folder is currently ‘fixed’ – i.e., it cannot be renamed, moved, or deleted. This is because this folder is used by the system to hold shared content – this will probably be empty to begin with. This system is not set in stone and can be re-organised, depending on feedback. You can read more at Sharing ContentThe search box can be used to filter the list of documents that are displayed:Full text search over documentsTag searchBy document nameDocument form typeModification datesThe Examples folder contains several example documents that have been created automatically by the system to demonstrate the type of content RSpace can hold.Clicking on on one or more checkboxes beside documents in the table activates a secondary toolbar with various available operations (see section below).IconsIcons are used in the Type column to show at a glance what you are looking at:MiniprofileClicking on the name of a user in the Owner column will pop open a miniprofile with information on that user, as well as buttons to directly send a message to them and open their full profile. Clicking on a user's name also works in other places, such as group pages.Managing DocumentsSelecting the checkbox of one or more documents in the Workspace will open a secondary toolbar. Different options will be available depending on the files selected and their properties, such as share status.The main options available for documents are:Duplicate: creates a completely new and independent document. Comments, sketches and image annotations are also copiedMove: moves a document in and out of folders and notebooksRename: renames the document for all users who can view the documentDelete: marks a document as "deleted", but does not delete it from the database. To restore a deleted document, see Revisions and DeletionsExport: exports the work in a selected format, see Export Options for moreAdd to Favorites: makes the document easily accessible using Favorites filter in the main toolbarShare: users can share documents within groups or with individual users, see LabGroups and Sharing Content for more informationOrganising your WorkspaceHome folderYou can organise Documents into folders and move folders inside folders, using the Move button (see "Managing Documents" above). For related Documents or sequential pieces of work, you can use Notebooks, which make Document browsie easier and can be shared in their entirety.How you organise your home folder is up to you – nobody else can alter this. Each user has their own folder tree and can organise documents in their own way, except for the Shared folder, which is not editable. Unless you enable Open Lab Autosharing, only the PIs of your LabGroups can see the files in your home folder.Shared FolderAll users have a Shared folder, which contains all shared content. Content needs to be explicitly shared to appear in the Shared folder; the Move action does not move Documents into the Shared folder. Read more at Sharing Content.The GalleryFiles such as images or PDFs, which you can add to your documents, are stored in a separate section of RSpace called the Gallery. This enables a clear separation between Documents, which are kept in the Workspace, and supporting materials, which can be added to Documents, but are stored and organised independently in the Gallery.How did we do?Related ArticlesWorkspace Views and Filters[Video] Use Workspace Filters in RSpaceImport New Documents from Word(opens in a new tab)Powered by HelpDocs(opens in a new tab)×ContactSend

The published document is 'live' - any edit to the document within RSpace is visible in the published view of the document as soon as that edit is saved. Documents can be unpublished but users should be aware that web caches/search engine indexing mean that this process may leave traces of documents visible on the internet. Users can determine if a published document allows SEO bots to index it or not. This setting can be overriden by PIs and RSpace admins.See also: Published Documents and Unpublishing Documents, Managing published content and Enabling Publication of documents in your Lab GroupSimple summaryAs a lab group member, I want to publish my document, what do I need to do?Get your PI to enable the group publication feature (see Enabling Publication of documents in your Lab Group), then follow the "Publishing a Document" steps below.As a lab group member, I want to publish a document which has been shared with me, what do I need to do?For the sake of privacy and security, we have made this impossible.As a lab group member, I want to unpublish my documents, what do I need to do?You can automatically unpublish documents which you published from the 'My RSpace' -> 'Published Documents' tab. However, you cannot unpublish your documents which were published by your PI.Published NotebooksNotebooks which are published make all current and future entries in the notebook public without explicitly publishing those entries, meaning there is no direct public link to the notebook entries. Therefore, adding a new item to a published notebook makes it public because viewers of the public link to the notebook will see the item as an entry in the notebook. Removing that item from the published notebook will then make it not public.Entries in notebooks can be explicitly published: these entries will have a public link that directly points to them (not the notebook). This public link will work, regardless of whether the item is in a public or unpublic notebook. You would use the 'unpublish' process, described below, if you wished to make this item private again. Note that unpublishing a notebook does not unpublish its entries, if those entries were explicitly published.Enabling PublicationSee Enabling Publication of documents in your Lab Group for the process to be handled by PIs.Once enabled by the System/Community Admin, PIs may publish documents which they own or have been shared with them by Lab Group members. (Note - sharing across collaboration groups does not enable PI publication). If a PI chooses to enable publication in their Lab Group, then ANY member of the Lab Group may publish documents which they own. As a Lab Group member, you may not publish documents which have been shared with you but which you do not own.Publishing a DocumentYou may publish any document(s) in your Workspace that show the Publish icon when you click on the documents' checkbox.Type 'confirm', then click Publish for the documents to be published.The publish UI depends on whether sysadmins and LabGroup PIs have enabled SEO for public documents. If they have, you can chose whether to 'Publish a link' or to 'Publish on the internet'. (If sysadmins/PIs have not enabled SEO for public documents, you may only chose to 'Publish a link'). If you chose to 'Publish a link', robots are prevented from indexing your public document. Your published document will not be visible on the new 'Published' page.Optionally enter a description for the published document. This will help external users to find the document and will aid SEO (it is used as meta data). The description will be visible in the document header.Check the box 'Display contact details?' if you wish to have your email address visible in the document header.The description will also be visible on the 'published' documents page (see below).Once publication is complete, a success message informs you of how many documents were published and lets you know that the filenames and public URLs are in your clipboard. You may paste these somewhere for immediate sharing.This works by default on Chrome/Firefox and Edge.On Safari, links cannot be written to the clipboard, so a 'copy latest links' button will appear at the top left of the page instead. Clicking on this button will copy links to published documents into your clipboard. The links will be lost if you leave the page without clicking on the button.If you don't use one of the four browsers mentioned above, you should see the 'copy latest links' button if your browser requires you to use it.If you publish a subsequent document, links in the clipboard are replaced with the new link. The 'copy latest links' button also has its link contents replaced. Public links can also be obtained later on by visiting the 'My RSpace' -> 'Published Documents' tab.Published documents are identified in your Workspace by having a 'published icon':And in the text editor by displaying the same icon:What is visible in a published document?The published document is not a 100% copy of the document as viewed by a logged-in RSpace user:Info popups and preview popups have been removed as they reveal private information such as document IDs and file system structures.Links to media files stored in your Gallery will be enabled.Links to media files stored on remote file systems have been disabled.Links to RSpace documents will be disabled unless those documents are also public.Disabled links are translucent. In the following example, 'Chlorella Virus Plaque Assay' was published. whereas 'Empty Notebook' was not. DSC00950.jpeg is a link to an image stored on a remote SFTP filesystem, and therefore is also disabled. Total RNA C elegans.doc is a link to a media file stored in the user's documents Gallery and so is enabled.The 'published documents' view in 'My RSpace'.There is a new view of published documents under the 'My RSpace' tab. You can also use this to unpublish documents.See 'Published Documents and Unpublishing Documents' for more details.The 'Published' documents pageIf your sysadmin/community admin has enabled 'public_sharing', RSpace has a new 'Published' documents tab.This is also visible to the internet, for non RSPace users:The Published documents page displays the name of the publisher, the link to the published document and any description. This page is also searchable. Any member of the public can use this page to find published documents of interest to them.Troubleshooting login issues after using public documentsUnauthenticated RSpace users can very occasionaly be caught up in a log in issue after viewing public documents. If a public document is viewed in a browser window and then a new tab is opened, with an attempt made to access an RSpace url, redirection to the RSpace Login page from that tab may be blocked. The user only ever gets blocked if a) they were unathenticated in that browser window and b) they first opened a public document and c) then attempted to access RSpace. However, even in this scenario, users will normally not be blocked and will normally be redirected to the /login page when required.Under the rare circumstances that a user is blocked from redirection to the /login page, the solution is to go to the /login url directly - eg type <your RSpace host>/login in the browser - and you will then see the login page.How did we do?Related ArticlesPublished Documents and Unpublishing DocumentsManaging published contentEnabling Publication of Documents in your Lab Group(opens in a new tab)Powered by HelpDocs(opens in a new tab)×ContactSend

If you are both an Administrator and a contributing scientist, then you will need two different logins for those two different roles. Administrator accounts are free and do not contribute to your total number of licensed seats. The System tab provides administrators with tools to manage individual users, to manage groups and communities, and to monitor and troubleshoot user activity. Only RSpace Administrators and System Administrators can access this tab. RSpace Admins’ actions are limited to affecting only their own Community, while full System Administration is deployment-wide.Tools to the left of the toolbar are used to create and manage entities in the RSpace deployment – from individual users and the roles or permissions they are granted, to LabGroups managed by PIs and Lab Admins, to Communities, which are an administrative block of groups which are able to see and interact with each other, comparable to a department or faculty. On the right of the toolbar are tools for administration and maintenance of the system, from scheduling down-time to configuring deployment properties and troubleshooting user problems.Your default System tab page is the SysAdmin Directory of all users – a list of all the users on the system, which can be used to contact or view information about any individual. The page is headed up with a summary overview of user statistics, and the individual entries also give insight into the basic space use and document count of each user. The list is initially paginated, but a ‘Show All’ button allows creation of a single page list of the entire user-set, for copying or exporting.The ‘Active Users’ tab shows a list of users currently logged into the system. When scheduling downtime a list of active users is also shown.

If you are considering using a SaaS version of RSpace (RSpace Team, or RSpace Enterprise hosted on AWS), we take care of all this setup.IntroductionThis page lists the fundamental components of the RSpace application, and the software/hardware system setup needed.RSpace is a web-based application, so end-users can access all functionality through their browsers and no software installation by users is necessary.RSpace ComponentsA Java web application packaged as .war web application file (provided by RSpace).An Apache Tomcat or similar web application server capable of running Java web applications (installed by host).A MariaDB database server (installed by host).A database initialization script (provided by RSpace).A Filestore for storing media or other binary files uploaded into RSpace (provided by host). This should be a regular file directory, mounted on a separate drive from the system drive to facilitate OS updates and backup.A deployment.properties file allows ResearchSpace engineers or your qualified IT professionals to configure a number of server properties and behaviors. Instructions for working with the deployment.properties file are included in the installation file that came with your server (called something like: RSpaceConfiguration.md)Software Requirements for the Web ServerUbuntu 20.04 LTS or 22.04 LTS or Debian 12Java SDK version 17, openJDK-based build.Apache web server v2.4. RSpace must be configured to support HTTPS using Apache ssl modulesApache Tomcat 9.xMariaDB 10.3. For small deployments of < 100 users this can be on the webserver; for larger deployments we recommend a dedicated database server.The above components are on standard packages in Ubuntu 20.04 LTS and Debian 12.All of these can be installed by the customer IT team but remote install by our technicians is strongly recommended.We supply an auxiliary Java application to run on the server to perform document conversions to/from MSOffice format.If you want us to do a full end-to-end installation, we just require a standard OS on the server and we will install all required software.Hardware RequirementsA Linux-based server with at least 8Gb RAM. For larger installs ( > 100 users) we would recommend setting up two additional servers - one for the database and one for additional microservices.WebServer: accept incoming HTTP requests on port 80 and HTTPS requests on port 443DatabaseServer: can be on private network, with port 3306 open to WebServer. 8Gb RAM recommended initially. MicroserviceServer: can be on private network, with ports 8081-8099 accepting incoming HTTP requests from WebServer. 4GB RAM is sufficient initiallyHere is a very rough estimation of required resources for the main web server, based on our experience managing AWS t2/t3 instancesNumber of usersRecommended RAM (Gb)Recommended CPUs< 508 ( t2.large)2-450-25016 ( t2.xlarge)4-8250 - 500032 ( t2.2xlarge)8Sufficient file storage, writable from the web application, to store files uploaded by end users. The default Filestore is a simple file-system accessible from the web server; RSpace just needs to be told the top-level folder of the file-system. The amount of storage depends hugely on the type of research and the users' work and usage of RSpace. Here is a rough estimate based on current usage.Number of usersInitial storage requirements for setup and initial few months' usageStorage should scale<5050Gb1Gb/person/year50-250250Gb1Gb/person/year250 - 5000250GB to 1Tb1Gb/person/yearSufficient disk space for the MariaDB database; as a rough initial estimate, 10-50Mb per user should be ample to begin with since files and raw data are stored on the filestore, not in the database. The database makes many IO operations. Ideally an SSD drive provides best performance.For performance, the minimal performance should be comparable to that of AWS's t2.medium instance, which is our standard server used for up to 50 users. Here is a test of cpu and i/o performance using sysbench on an AWS t2.medium with standard gp2 SSD drive. Performance should be comparable to this for a minimal install.> sysbench --test=cpu --cpu-max-prime=20000 runCPU speed:    events per second:   354.18General statistics:    total time:                          10.0012s    total number of events:              3543Latency (ms):         min:                                  2.80         avg:                                  2.82         max:                                  4.13         95th percentile:                      2.86         sum:                               9990.64> sysbench --test=fileio --file-total-size=5G prepare> sysbench --test=fileio --file-total-size=5G --file-test-mode=rndrw  --max-time=300 --max-requests=0 runFile operations:    reads/s:                      111.85    writes/s:                     74.57    fsyncs/s:                     238.22Throughput:    read, MiB/s:                  1.75    written, MiB/s:               1.17General statistics:    total time:                          300.3919s    total number of events:              127559Latency (ms):         min:                                  0.00         avg:                                  2.35         max:                               1426.36         95th percentile:                      4.10         sum:                             300047.73Threads fairness:    events (avg/stddev):           127559.0000/0.00    execution time (avg/stddev):   300.0477/0.00Other componentsRSpace sends emails notifications to users, so access to a mail server is required. We can provide an email relay service.RSpace will only run over HTTPS. Therefore, installation of a valid SSL certificate is required. Our staff can generate a CSR from the server once we have access to it.RSpace uses additional software components to generate in-browser previews of MSOffice files and DNA sequence files - see Installation of RSpace add-on services for details.If you would like RSpace to connect to your SingleSignOn mechanism, extra configuration is needed - please see Setting up SingleSignOn authentication.Browser Requirements for End-UsersA modern, Javascript-enabled browser is essential for the HTML5 Canvas elements we use for sketching and image annotation. We aim to support current versions of Safari, Firefox and Chrome no more than 2 years old. RSpace may also work with newest versions of MS Edge, (now that it is Chromium-based), and other browsers like Opera, Brave and Chromium without issue, but we do not specifically support these. Please note we do not support older versions of Internet Explorer and will not address issues specific to this browser.Starting, stopping, and restarting your RSpace serverRSpace is gracefully stopped or started using the command line to stop and start tomcat. The details can vary depending on your OS, and where and how tomcat was installed on your server. If you look for the installation file that came with your server (called something like: RSpaceConfiguration.md) you will see that the command for starting and stopping RSpace servers gracefully is provided there. If you are not comfortable with using the command line for this sort of task, you probably should ask for help from your University IT team or email Research Space support at support@researchspace.com.For more information on hosting options, initial installation and installing updates for on-premise RSpace deployments see: Deploying RSpace.Looking for instructions for installing or updating your on-premise RSpace server? Before installing or updating any on-premise RSpace server, always refer to the version-specific documentation files (e.g. RSpaceConfiguration.md) included with the download bundle for your version.

This could be useful if your organisation holds large, private research datasets on S3.This feature relies on an AWS service called an AWS Storage Gateway. The storage gateway can be deployed as an EC2 instance (see https://docs.aws.amazon.com/storagegateway/latest/userguide/ec2-gateway-file.html). It acts as a bridge between a Samba or NFS filesystem clients and S3.This enables RSpace to link to files and objects in S3 using the same functionality used to link to regular Samba file systems.This feature is still experimental and we welcome the opportunity to work with interested customers.After setting up the Gateway, file-shares can be set up, and the configuration information used to connect RSpace to the FileShares. Each Gateway can support up to 10 S3 buckets.PrerequisitesVPC(Virtual Public Cloud) set up along with VPC endpoints for both storage gateway and S3IAM roles, one allowing access to storage gateway, one for S3 with required regions, and optionally one for the S3 bucket you wish to create the file share on.How could this be used?There are several use-cases this could support:Customer already has an AWS FileGateway backed by one or more S3 buckets. In this case, RSpace could connect to file-shares that exist already.Customer has data in one more S3 buckets. A FileGateway and FileShares could be created to enable RSpace to connect to these buckets.Here is a diagram showing the various components.What are likely problems or challenges?Permissions and access control would depend on who has access to the S3 bucket and the file-shares, and how that relates to permissions and identities in RSpace. There are many possible scenarios.Related documentsStoring RSpace archives on S3 describes a simpler scenario, where RSpace XML and HTML archives can be stored directly on S3.How did we do?Related ArticlesStoring RSpace archives on S3Adding Anchor Links to DocumentsDeploying RSpace(opens in a new tab)Powered by HelpDocs(opens in a new tab)×ContactSend

User access policySignup-scenario 1: Users self-signupSignup-scenario 2: Users are white-listed by an administratorWhich signup scenario to choose?4. Testing and sign-off5. Using the same SSO user to access multiple RSpace accountsGlossary and acronymsSingle Sign-On is only available to RSpace Enterprise customers.This article explains how to set up SSO for RSpace using the SAML2 protocol. It applies equally to both on-premises and SaaS deployments.If you are looking for direct LDAP authentication, please see this article.Introduction to Identity in RSpaceResearch data may need to be kept for decades after creation, and it's essential to be able to refer back to the person who created the work, even if that person has changed their name since.RSpace uses a username to identify users. An RSpace username is immutable and remains eternally unique. This is so that work performed by an individual can be reliably tracked over time, in log files and exports, and is always traceable back to the same individual.This means that an RSpace username obtained from an IdP (Identity Provider) should not be a changeable value. In many cases, the credentials used to authenticate to an IdP are mutable, so an IdP login username may not make a good RSpace username.For this reason, we encourage the use of a unique identifer - e.g. the value of the 'eppn' attribute released by the IdP - as the RSpace username.Before starting...Setting up SSO can involve several different people at an institution with different roles, e.g. in Identity/Access Management, Data Protection/Privacy, and IdP (Identity Provider) configuration.In our experience after performing many installations, the process is greatly smoothened if people with these different roles are aware of each other, and have the authorisation to make decisions required to make the system work.Research Space will appoint one technical contact, and one customer support contact to handle the setup.SAML-based SSO setupOnce a running RSpace server is available, accessible from the IdP and secured by HTTPS, SSO setup can proceed. There are are four phases:Technical setup to connect the Identity Provider with RSpace (the Service Provider).Create initial RSpace admin accounts. The usernames created in RSpace MUST exactly the unique IdP ID of the user (usually the SSO username that the user logs in with). There is also an option for "self signup" which automatically generates accounts in RSpace with the correct username when an authenticated user visits the RSpace server for the first time.Choose a policy for how users will access RSpace.Test and sign-off.Step 3 can proceed independently of steps 1 and 2.Each step is explained in more detail below. It's important that the system is not made generally available for end-users until step 4 (testing and sign-off by RSpace and the customer) is completed.1. Technical setupResearch Space will work with customer technical contact to exchange SAML metadata and agree on URLs and SAML attribute names.The mandatory requirement is that your Identity Provider (IdP) releases one identifying attribute that uniquely and immutably identifies a single user, and you let us know its name and nameFormat. This will become the 'username' in RSpace.  Additional, optional attributes are email, first name and last name.  For example if you use Azure, it might release a user-identifying SAML attribute name="http://schemas.xmlsoap.org/ws/2005/05/identity/claims/name" nameFormat="urn:oasis:names:tc:SAML:2.0:attrname-format:unspecified" .The steps to set this up are as follows: We exchange metadata. RSpace needs your IdP-metadata.xml and your IdP need RSpace's service-provider (SP) metadata.xml. You can provide your IdP metadata either as a URL or as a file.You tell us the name and format of the attributes your IdP is releasing ( or even better, send us the body of the assertion  POST to https://YOUR_RSPACE_URL/Shibboleth.sso/SAML2/POST) . We configure Apache Shibboleth on the RSpace server to deal with these attributes and send them to RSpace.If at all possible, it's very helpful if Research Space staff can troubleshoot independently. For this we either need access to a test/sandbox Idp environment or a guest account on the real IdP. If this can't be accomplished, then we will need the assistance of the customer to help verify the SAML exchange is occurring correctly.Required SAML attributesAn attribute containing the user's unique, immutable ID is the only mandatory attribute required.For Signup Scenario 1 (self-signup), the initial user experience is enhanced if the email,first name andlast name can also be made available as SAML attributes. A user can edit these values in RSpace if they choose, either at signup time, or later in their profile page.1a. LogoutWhen users click to Logout in RSpace, this can either just log them out of RSpace, or log them out of their SSO session. If you want the latter to happen (this is most secure option if using shared computers), then please lst us know a logout URL of your IdP.2. Creating initial admin accountsAdmin roles in RSpace are used to manage user accounts and configure the application. Admin roles must be created manually using the RSpace web interface. Admin accounts should not be used for regular RSpace usage. If someone wants to have both an admin account and an RSpace user account, please see section 5.RSpace can run either in 'SSO' mode, or 'standalone' mode using its own internal user authentication. During initial setup, RSpace will run in 'standalone' mode so that the internal sysadmin can login and create new admin accounts.When RSpace is installed, an internal sysadmin user 'sysadmin1' is automatically created by RSpace. This sysadmin account is not linked to any SSO identity, but is used to 'bootstrap' the system and create an initial set of admin users that are linked to an SSO identity.To create a new admin account in RSpace, you need to know the unique user ID, email and name of the person. See Create New Users (for System Admins) for details. Either Research Space staff or customer staff can assume the internal sysadmin role to perform this process.It's essential that the unique id (the user-identifying SAML attribute value that will be provided in a SAML assertion) is used for the RSpace username.Running RSpace in Standalone mode, and logged in as sysadmin1 user, create one or more system admin users.After restarting RSpace in SSO mode, the newly created sysadmin users can login to RSpace via SSO and have full access to configure RSpace and create more users.3. User access policyThere are two ways that end-users can start using RSpace.Signup-scenario 1: Users self-signupThe first time new users go to RSpace, they will be redirected to the Identity Provider's login page, and will need to authenticate.After authentication, users will be redirected to an RSpace signup page, pre-populated with some profile information released from the IdP, and confirming they want an account.RSpace can be configured to let users self-identify as PIs, in which case a LabGroup will automatically be set up for them. If this option is disabled, people signing up this way will just have regular user accounts, and an administrator can later convert a user account to a PI account.Upon signing up, the new user will go straight through to the RSpace Workspace and they will occupy 1 license seat. They can start using RSpace immediately.On subsequent logins, users will go straight to RSpace after authenticating with the IdP.Signup-scenario 2: Users are white-listed by an administratorIn this scenario, anybody using RSpace must be 'white-listed' and an account be previously created by an RSpace administrator.The RSpace username must match the unique IdP ID of the user (the value of the user-identifying SAML2 attribute). This is the key mechanism that RSpace uses to identify users. This unique ID might not be the same as username used to login into the IdP.An System Admin can create user accounts of any type: User, PI, Community Admin or System Admin. In this approach, some initial System Admin users can be created by RSpace technical staff, to bootstrap the system. These admins can then create any new user accounts they wish. When a whitelisted user tries to access RSpace, after authentication, they will go straight to the RSpace Workspace, without a sign-up page confirmation.Which signup scenario to choose?Scenario 1 (self-signup) is much less admin work. People sign up to RSpace without any admin involvement.If you are concerned that people will sign up and not use the system, denying other users a license seat, these dormant accounts can later be disabled by a sysadmin, freeing up a license seat.You can think of this approach as an 'optimistic' approach; that people will largely do the right thing, and mistakes/unintended signups can be rectified later.Scenario 2 (white-listed signup) is a good solution if you want full control over exactly which individuals can use RSpace. This means manually creating user accounts for every user wishing to use RSpace.It gives you total control over management of license seats. You must know, or be able to find out, the unique user-identifying SAML2 attribute value for each user in order to set these as usernames for the accounts you create.Although RSpace can be switched from one sign-up scenario to the other, we recommend you decide which mechanism you prefer before making RSpace available for general use.It is also possible to create multiple users by batch upload from a CSV file containing user details, or via the RSpace API.4. Testing and sign-offBefore making RSpace generally available to end-users, the authentication flow should be tested by the customer to ensure that:Login and logout work as expected.The correct user-access policy is in place.At least one admin user has access to RSpace using SSO authentication.ResearchSpace staff will also confirm that the system is ready for use.This testing phase will ensure a smooth initial experience for new users, and reduce the risk of authentication-related support requests both to Research Space and the customer.5. Using the same SSO user to access multiple RSpace accountsWe support this in a limited manner, for example if you setting up an account for someone who is both an adminstrator and end-user of RSpace. Please read:Using multiple RSpace accounts with the same SSO identity andCreating a backdoor login accountfor details of how to set up these accounts.Glossary and acronymseppneduPersonPrincipalName: A SAML attribute containing a unique, ideally unchanging username.

However, this document highlights various information about the SaaS offering that might be useful to the IT staff of an organization that has opted for the Team Edition.Option 1: Research Space operates RSpace as a SaaS offering installed on an AWS server that we manage for you.In this scenario, RSpace is deployed on your own private AWS instance in the cloud. There is no charge for this service. The price of the AWS instance in included in your purchase. Installation, backup, updates and maintenance are all performed by Research Space. For Team edition, ResearchSpace will select a data center location for you from the following list:us-east-1 virginiaus-west-1 californiaeu-west-1 irelandeu-west-2 londoneu-central-1 frankfurteu-central-2 zurichap-northeast-2 seoulap-southeast-2 sydneyOrganizations who purchase RSpace Enterprise edition may request any AWS regional data center necessary to meet your data storage and regulatory requirements. Hosting on AWS is good option if you:Are unable or unwilling to dedicate staff time to installing and maintaining RSpace.Want complete convenience and to get up and running quickly.Anticipate expanding usage over time but do not have suitable resources of your own to accommodate this - AWS is essentially is unlimited in terms of data storage capability.Option 2. (Requires RSpace Enterprise Edition). You install and operate RSpace within a suitable on-premises environment that you provide.In this scenario, RSpace is installed on your institutional system - either physical machines, virtual hosts or an existing private cloud instance that you either own and manage. You can learn more about how to install RSpace. This scenario is good if:Your data-compliance guidelines require you to store research data on-premises.You are able to dedicate some staff time to installing and maintaining and updating RSpace. Your IT team will need to download update bundles from a site maintained by ResearchSpace and install the update by precisely following the instructions included with the bundle.You have staff with IT experience in managing web applications in a Linux environment.You want absolute ownership and control over all aspects of the data life cycle, for example backup and recovery.If your organization has opted to manage your Enterprise Edition server, but you allow you server to fall more than 4 major releases the current release, then additional surcharges will apply if ResearchSpace staff need to assist you with a complex, multistep, update path through many versions. It is absolutely critical that if you opt to manage your own server, you MUST assign appropriate IT resources to keep the server updated regularly.Ultimately it is the customer's responsibility to make sure that you are using the latest version. You can see the current version of your server at the bottom left of the interface. It will be of the form 1.x.x. You can see the current release version in the changelog.Before installing or updating any on-premise RSpace server, always refer to the version-specific documentation files (e.g. RSpaceConfiguration.md) included with the download bundle for your version. Contact ResearchSpace for access to the download URL. For security reasons, you will not find those detailed instructions anywhere in our online documentation. Installation / update instructions are only available within the download bundle, and installation / update should only be attempted by qualified IT professionals.Option 3. (Requires RSpace Enterprise Edition). Research Space remotely installs RSpace within a suitable on-premises environment that you provide.This is a hybrid solution, where you want RSpace on-premises but don't want to delegate IT staff time to installing the system. In this case, you set up the infrastructure and Research Space will install and update the RSpace software via a secure remote connection. Responsibility for backup /disaster recovery and operating system maintenance is on the customer. This scenario is good if:Your data-compliance guidelines require you to store research data on-premises.You have limited knowledge of RSpace, but have experience managing Linux servers.Here, the process would typically be:A kick-off meeting to meet each other and establish a procedure and timeline for the installation, and to confirm infrastructure requirements.Customer sets up infrastructure (e.g. virtual servers) with vanilla Ubuntu and grants SSH access to ResearchSpace installation technician.ResearchSpace performs basic installationSingle SignOn / integrations are set up as required.RSpace is made available to users.RSpace connectivityRSpace does not operate in isolation from your institutional data; in fact it shines when connecting and linking your research work together. In this section we review how the different deployment options described above affect these aspects of RSpace functionality.Single Sign OnIf you want your users to access and login to RSpace using Single Sign On, RSpace supports this for RSpace Enterprise Edition using the SAML2 protocol. Most Identity Providers (IdPs) such as Okta, Azure AD etc., support this protocol. For more details, see Setting up SingleSignOn authenticationConnecting to your existing data storageRSpace can store and manage all sorts of data files, but there are occasions when your researchers will want to link to data files on an institutional file server rather than bringing the files into RSpace. This might be the case ifThe data files are huge, e.g. large images or sequencing files.Your data has to be stored on a particular file server for compliance reasons.RSpace can talk to these servers using either Samba or SFTP protocols. It just requires read access to list files to link to.This can be easier to set up for an on-prem installation; connecting from RSpace on AWS is entirely possible technically, but requires access from RSpace to your file-server. Please read Configuring Institutional File Systems for more detailsRSpace integrationsRSpace has integrations with many popular applications including Dropbox, Google Drive, OneDrive, Microsoft Teams, Slack, Office 365, protocols.io, Github, Figshare and Dataverse- see Integrations for a full list. The setup required for each integration is variable. If you are running RSpace as a SaaS (option 1 above) , ResearchSpace will be able to set up these integrations for you. If you are running RSpace on-prem (or, more specifically, the RSpace URL is not a researchspace.com URL), then you will have to configure these integrations, as they often require proof of domain ownership to set up (e.g. Google Drive).Branding image and custom linksRSpace Enterprise customers can customize the interface by adding an organizational branding / company logo image to the top right corner of the interface (replacing the standard RSpace image), and / or by adding up to 2 other custom text links in the page footer (e.g., pointing to a web page you maintain with information about data privacy policies, legal disclaimers, or other important information about using RSpace at your specific organization).Getting data out of RSpaceRSpace supports export to all standard formats - HTML, XML, PDF, Microsoft Word and JSON (via RSpace API). Users can export their data themselves, at any level of granularity from a single document to their entire body of work, at any time, and download the export to their own machines. Exports can be scheduled using the API - e.g. running a cron-job to invoke export once a week.If as a server administrator you want to do low-level data export, this is easily accomplished using standard, free tools. ELN metadata can be exported from the MySQL database using `mysqldump` or `Percona XtraBackup`), and from its internal file store via tools such as `rsync`.No data is stored in a binary format proprietary to RSpace.Sensitive dataStandard on prem and hosted RSpace deployments are not appropriate for entry of sensitive data (e.g., patient information subject to HIPAA or similar regulatory rules).   It is certainly possible, however, to deploy RSpace so that entry of sensitive data is supported and compliant.  Often, this issue comes up where usage in a medical school is planned.   In these situations, a solution is to deploy RSpace within a validated compliant environment you already use or that you create with assistance from ResearchSpace. Because of the increased cost of data storage and processing in these environments, it may even make sense to deploy a second instance of RSpace specifically for researchers who handle sensitive data, and researve your standard RSpace deployment for use by the majority of users, who don't need the extra 'compliance wrap'.In the USA, AWS GovCloud offers a compliant computing environment for organisations bound by federal data-handling regulations. RSpace has been installed successfully in this environment.Related: our privacy policy.Migration after a pilotCustomers often run a pilot of RSpace on AWS, before deciding to purchase an ongoing license. In that case you can decide whether to continue using the cloud instance as a production instance, or switching to an on-premises deployment. If you chose to move to an on-premises deployment, it's possible to migrate data that researchers entered into the cloud instance to the on-premises instance of RSpace.Data BackupFor on-premise deployments of RSpace, backup is solely the customer’s responsibility. We will consult with your IT personnel at the time of deployment. For backing up AWS-based RSpace instances, ResearchSpace uses scripts to automate the backup process that we are happy to share with customers on request.When deployed as SaaS (software as a service) onto an Amazon Web Services (AWS) private instance that we manage for you, ResearchSpace and Amazon take care of backups for you.Data is stored in a MySQL 5.7 or MariaDB10.3 database; files are stored unmodified on EBS volumes in a directory structure.We make hourly file syncs to S3 using AWS CLI toolNightly and weekly snapshots of instances and data volumes are stored as machine images (AMIs). These are fast to make, and support RTOs in the order of minutes.Logical database backups are made nightly, and stored on S3. Data Files, logs, configuration files and search indices are additionally synced to S3 hourly.For in-depth description, please read  SaaS Backup document.In addition, customers can use the export API endpoint to make additional, scheduled, bulk data exports to any destination you like to act as an additional redundant data backup.How did we do?Related ArticlesAdditional useful articles for IT staffOther useful articles for IT staffSystem Requirements for RSpace (for System Admins)(opens in a new tab)Powered by HelpDocs(opens in a new tab)×ContactSend

This use-case is designed for RSpace administrators who also want to use RSpace ELN as a regular user.If you act as both a user or PI in RSpace, AND you are ALSO a Sysadmin or Community admin, be sure that you use the appropriate account when you need to perform tasks related to those different roles.Do not add production data when logged in as a Sysadmin, or Community Admin, do not add Admins to any LabGroups, and do not try to use Sysadmin account to fill the PI or standard user role.Before startingYou'll need a working, installed RSpace 1.69.36 or newer.Follow Setting up SingleSignOn authentication guide so you know how regular user accounts and admin accounts can be created and managed using SSO.Use the flowchart below to determine whether this document applies to you. If you get to the final, pink, box, then please keep reading....If at all possible, it's better to use two separate SSO identities. This will help separate the two roles of researcher and adminstrator. The instructions below are for when this is not possible (for example, if your Identity Provider will not grant extra identities to the same individual person).Setting up dual admin/user accountsLet's start with an example. Alice Smith is a researcher who also manages an RSpace installation. She wants to have both an RSpace sysadmin account and a regular RSpace user account. She has university Id asmithand cannot get another one.Steps1. Sign up to RSpace for a user account using your SSO username (e.g. asmith ). This will be the default account; whenever you log into RSpace you will go to this regular user account.2. Ask an existing sysadmin user to create a backdoor sysadmin account, with a different username and email, e.g. asmith-admin. You will subsequently be able to perform a separate admin login from within RSpace to access this account and perform admin actions. This 'dual account' system still requires the user to be logged into RSpace through SSO. For security reasons, it is not possible to have a completely independent admin account that is not linked to an SSO identity, that could 'bypass' the SSO authentication system.Please see Setting up SingleSignOn authentication for details of getting started with an initial sysadmin account to bootstrap the system.Using the dual login system as admin user.Let's start from the situation that you are entirely logged out of SSO and RSpace, and you want to perform some admin actions.Login to RSpace via SSO, using your SSO credentials (e.g. asmith).Once in RSpace, navigate to the /adminLogin page. RSpace will internally log you out of the asmith account, but your SSO session will remain active.You must only have one RSpace browser tab opened at this point, i.e. close all other RSpace tabs before navigating to /adminLogin page.On Admin Login page, login as asmith-admin, using correct credentials.Perform your admin actions.Here you can open multiple RSpace browser tabs again.When you're finished, logout. You will be logged out of RSpace and the enclosing SSO session will be ended.Using the dual login system as a regular user.Just authenticate to RSpace using your SSO credentials (e.g. asmith) and use RSpace as normal. This is just the regular workflow used by RSpace users.How did we do?Related ArticlesSetting up Single Sign-On Authentication[Video] Using OneDrive with RSpaceMy Profile, Your RSpace Identity(opens in a new tab)Powered by HelpDocs(opens in a new tab)×ContactSend

RSpace staff will assist your RSpace IT admin to configure and test the systemStep 2- creating user accountsOnce connection settings are confirmed, user accounts will be created as follows:Creating admin users. There is an account 'sysadmin1' that can authenticate to RSpace without LDAP. This account can be manually used to create other users or admin users. The password for 'sysadmin1' account will be made available to your RSpace IT admin in a secure manner. These new admin users will also not use LDAP authentication, but instead use RSpace's internal authentication system.Any user logging into RSpace with LDAP credentials for the first time will get an account created for them automatically with 'USER' role.To create PI users, once a user has signed up, an admin user can promote the User account to PI so that LabGroups can be created. The PI can then invite users to join their group.How did we do?Related ArticlesSetting up Single Sign-On AuthenticationSetting up Orcid integrationSetting up Protocols.io integration(opens in a new tab)Powered by HelpDocs(opens in a new tab)×ContactSend

If you just want to create a new sysadmin user, and that user will just do admin work, and not want to use RSpace ELN as a researcher, then this document can be ignored.If you or one of your users plans to act as both a user (or PI) in RSpace, AND ALSO a Sysadmin or Community admin, it is important to use the appropriate account to perform tasks related to those different roles. Do not add production data when logged in as a Sysadmin, or Community Admin, do not add Admins to any LabGroups, and do not try to use Sysadmin account to fill the PI or standard user role.Know login credentials for the sysadmin1 account.Have access to RSpace server to be able to configure and restart it.What will happen?After completing the steps below, an RSpace user will be able to use RSpace both with a user account and an admin account. They will authenticate to RSpace using SSO credentials, which will give them access to their regular PI/user account in RSpace. They will then be able to authenticate as an 'internal admin' user to perform administrative actions in RSpace.Steps1. Setting up RSpace to enable creation of extra admin accountsIn deployment.properties, set:deployment.sso.backdoorUserCreation.enabled=truedeployment.standalone=trueand restart RSpace.2. Create new backdoor sysadmin login accountsLogin as 'sysadmin1' (RSpace's internal, pre-created sysadmin user) and create the new sysadmin accounts:You'll need to set a password for these accounts.The username can be anything you like, but it shouldn't be an SSO username, to avoid conflicts with existing or future usernames.Please use a different password from your SSO password.These backdoor accounts aren't tied to any particular user's SSO account. Therefore it's fine if this account is used as a service account by multiple people.These accounts don't bypass SSO authentication and can't be accessed directly. For security reasons, these accounts can only be accessed by a user who has already authenticated to RSpace using SSO authentication.3. Activating the adminLoginIn deployment.properties, configure RSpace to start using SSO authentication, and enable internal admin login:deployment.standalone=falsedeployment.sso.adminLogin.enabled=trueIf you don't want any existing sysadmin users to create new backdoor login accounts in future, set:deployment.sso.backdoorUserCreation.enabled=falseRestart RSpace.4. Testing the accountLogin to RSpace using your existing SSO credentials.In your browser, navigate to /adminLogin and login as the backdoor admin using the credentials you supplied in step 2.You should now be logged in as that admin user. You will see a special banner reminding you that you are logged in as an backdoor user.Logout5. Final stepsNotify the user(s) who you want to use this backdoor admin account. If users can self-signup (see Setting up SingleSignOn authentication) then they can signup and use RSpace directly. If not, and they don't have an existing user/PI account, then you'll need to create regular user/PI accounts for them.How did we do?Related ArticlesSetting up Single Sign-On AuthenticationChangelog - what's new?Creating a New LabGroup on the Community Edition server(opens in a new tab)Powered by HelpDocs(opens in a new tab)×ContactSend

RSpace users won't be able to use Filestores until this property is enabled.Configuring institutional File Systems is a task for system administrators (to see the current File System configuration you need a sysadmin account). As a sysadmin, navigate to the System tab, then click on ‘Configuration’ and ‘Institutional File Systems’ button.Example File System configurationManaging File SystemsThe ‘institutional File Systems’ page allows you to:add new File Systemsmodify existing File Systems (clicking on ‘Details’ button loads settings of that File System)delete unused File Systems (that operation fails if users have already created Filestores for that File System)Adding or modifying a File SystemSelecting ‘Details’ of existing File System, or clicking on ‘Add new File System’ button opens new panel, where details of the File System can be set.Add File System panelEach File System is a set of a following settings:Name – that’s the label for the File System that will be displayed to the usersURL – address of the File System server (should start with smb:// for Samba protocol)Status – whether system is enabled and users can use itClient type – RSpace supports connecting through SFTP or Samba protocolAuthentication Type – two authentication methods are supported:a) username/password – user is asked for external system credentials on their first connection to the file system in current sessionb) public key authentication – user can generate an SSH key pair with RSpace and register it with local key exchange service. This authentication method is tailored for University of Edinburgh public key infrastructure, so please contact RSpace first if you want to use it in your deployment.SFTP File System specific optionsWhen configuring SFTP File System you’ll see additional input field for SFTP server public key.Example File System – SFTP protocolYou need to provide a fingerprint of sftp server public key, so the secure connection can be established by RSpace. The fingerprint has to be in rsa-sha format (not ecdsa).On the RSpace server it can be obtained by connecting to the file server withssh -oHostKeyAlgorithms='ssh-rsa' username@mysftpserver.orgthen checking .ssh/known_hosts file on RSpace server.

You may need to edit /etc/ssh/sshd_configto enable challenge based-authentication:ChallengeResponseAuthentication yes Samba File System specific optionsWhen configuring Samba File System you’ll see additional input field for Samba domain.You need to provide a Samba domain that users using this File System belong to.Samba protocol type (since RSpace 1.67)RSpace provides two connectors allowing connection to Samba servers, both supporting different versions of Samba protocol. To use the original Samba protocol (JCIFS) select 'SMBv1' as a protocol type. If your storage server only supports newer Samba protocol (SMB2/3), then try 'SMBv2/3' type.When using SMBv2/3 connector you have to provide Share Name. This is usually the first path element after server hostname, e.g. if your Samba store is located at smb://pangolin.researchspace.com/samba-folder, then configure the connector using smb://pangolin.researchspace.com as a URL and samba-folder as a Share Name.iRODS File System Specific OptionsRSpace can connect to instances of the iRODS data management software (see iRODS Integration for full details).Select the iRODS option from the institutional file systems configuration page and enter the details of the iRODS instance you wish to connect to as detailed below:After migration of Institutional File SystemDuring the lifetime of RSpace deployment it may happen that Institutional File System is moved to a different location (URL), or that the folder structure is changed. In some cases it may be possible to keep the filestore links added to RSpace documents to work after migration, but that depends on how different the new paths are.RSpace users interact with Institutional File Systems by creating links to resources on the Institutional File System server. The path to resource is saved in RSpace as 3 fragments:URL to the File System server - configurable by system administrator on ‘System’ screen.Filestore path - path fragment chosen by user to point to their starting location on a given File Systempath to the specific linked file - within selected FilestoreConsider user-created SMB url to the test.txt file, with full path like this:smb://howler/samba-folder/Bio Multi Meßsystem/otherFolder/test.txtFor this example, the 3 fragments saved in RSpace are:smb://howler/samba-folder is a File System server part, configured by System Admin on System screen:/Bio Multi Meßsystem/otherFolder/ is the filestore path, selected by the user when creating Filestore to use for the particular File System:/test.txt is the path to actual resource, on the selected Filestore, selected by the user when writing up an RSpace documentNow let's assume the files at smb://howler system were migrated to a different server.If the change only affects File System part of the path, System Admin can just update details of pre-existing File System, and the pre-existing links created by the users should keep working.E.g. if the file smb://howler/samba-folder/Bio Multi Meßsystem/otherFolder/test.txt is now accessible at smb://pangolin/migrated-samba-folder/Bio Multi Meßsystem/otherFolder/test.txt it'll be enough if System Admin updates URL and share-name of the server on System configuration page.If the change affects part of the path saved with Filestore, there is currently no way in RSpace UI to fix these links. User should re-create the links pointing to new File System and newly created Filestore.E.g. if the file smb://howler/samba-folder/Bio Multi Meßsystem/otherFolder/test.txt is now accessible at smb://pangolin/migrated-samba-folder/migrated-bio/otherFolder/test.txt the only way to keep the links working would be for System Admin to update URL and share-name of the server on System configuration page, then to run SQL command updating NfsFileStore.path column in database so filestores previously pointing to Bio Multi Meßsystem/otherFolder are now pointing to migrated-bio/otherFolder.If the change affects part of the path saved with ELN document, there is no way to fix these links.

How does RSpace store files? Are there configurable options? - RSpace Help                        Contact us                                              RSpace Website                      Contact                    All Categories                                    ​ > ​                    ​For System Administrators                  ​ > ​                                         How does RSpace store files? Are there configurable options?                How does RSpace store files? Are there configurable options?                            Updated 4 months ago                                                      by                            RSpace Support                          There are four ways that RSpace can store and link to files. This document provides some background information into the ways RSpace can work with new or existing data in various locations.1. RSpace Internal file storeBy default, RSpace stores all uploaded files, unaltered, on a file-system outside the RSpace database. We store references to the files in the database, and text-files (including Word, PDF etc) are indexed for full-text search from the ELN.The file-system and directory structure is opaque to end users; they have no direct access to it, because it is on the RSpace server. From the user's perspective, files added to RSpace reside in their own personal storage area called the Gallery. The metadata about permissions, whose file it is, etc, are stored in the database. This has several advantages compared to storing the files direct as BLOBs in the database, for example: The files can all be backed up, copied, audited or retrieved using standard Unix commands. The database remains a manageable size for backup and recovery.  … at the cost of some additional complexity (hidden in the internals of RSpace) to coordinate file locations and database metadata.The internal file store works well for files that can be conveniently uploaded through the web interface or API - Office documents, PDFs, most images etc. The maximum allowable size for the files stored in RSpace is configurable on a server-by-server basis using a setting in the server properties file. You can for example set this to something quite small (e.g. 250 kb if you want to encourage users to keep most of their files somewhere else, or you can set it to something larger (e.g. 1 GB) if you want users to enjoy the convenience of drag-and-drop addition of larger files into RSpace. We generally don't recomend setting the max file size to a value higher than about 2 GB. For files larger than taht we would generally recommend external storage (see below).2. RSpace External File SystemsExternal file systems are only available to users on an Enterprise instance of RSpace.It may be the case that researchers already have large volumes of data on existing institutional file servers, or the files are too large to conveniently upload through a web interface. RSpace can connect to these file systems through Samba (SMB) or SFTP protocols.Normally this is used read-only to make links to datasets from the ELN, however in the future we plan to support file writing as well. This solution is good for linking to large files that you do not want to physically copy to RSpace; but if for SMB / SFTP file-systems that are also accessible by users from outside RSpace it can be a challenge to deal with broken links/ deleted files etc.Once solution to the problem of lbroken links to externana files is to make use of RSpace's ability to link to files in your University's iRODs middleware layer.RSpace can be configured to link to files in an unlimited number of External File Systems, and these can work alongside the RSpace File Store as well. Linking to files in your existing Amazon S3 buckets is also an option.3. Linking to Cloud File App files (Dropbox, GoogleDrive, Box, OneDrive, Owncloud)RSpace can link to files in existing popular cloud-based file stores. In this way, disparate resources held across multiple environments can be brought together with the lab's research documents in RSpace.4. RSpace Remote File StoreRemote file store is only available to users on an Enterprise instance of RSpace.We recently completed a substantial refactoring of the RSpace FileStore such that it can store files in a remote back end, using Egnyte https://www.egnyte.com as a proof-of-principle. Our plan is to enable RSpace to be able to work with a variety of file backends - including object stores such as S3, Minio or Azure Blob Storage.How did we do?Related Articles[Video] Export Files in RSpace[Video] Manage File Information in RSpaceHow RSpace Can Help Prevent Falsification(opens in a new tab)Powered by HelpDocs(opens in a new tab)×ContactSend

These properties are configurable by Sysadmin/Community Admin and individual PIs.Quick summaryI want to allow users to publish links to documents but those documents should be hidden from SEO: enable the new 'public_sharing' property.I also want to give user the choice to have their published documents indexed by robots for SEO and visible to the general public: enable the new 'publicdocs_allow_seo' property.I want all public documents to be taken down so that links to them no longer work: disable the new 'public_sharing' property.See also: Published Documents and Unpublishing Documents, Publication of Documents and Enabling Publication of documents in your Lab GroupPublication'Publishing' a document allows non RSpace users read-only permissions via a public link which is generated for the document. The published document is 'live' - any edit to the workspace document is visible in the published view of the document as soon as that edit is saved. Documents can be unpublished but users should be aware that web caches/search engine indexing etc mean that this process may leave traces of documents visible on the internet.As a sysadmin/community admin you can toggle publishing on and off . Disabling publishing will stop new publications and render all links to published documents non functional. You may also toggle whether public documents are indexable by robots for SEO. This property also determines if published documents have summaries displayed on a public 'published' documents page that is accessible to everyone. See below for further information.EnablingAs a System Admin, you can toggle globally whether PI users of RSpace are allowed to publish content. PI users can then enable their group members to also publish content. Users of RSpace who are not in any groups cannot publish content. Community Admins may do the same for all members of their communities. Under the 'System' tab, go to 'Configuration' then 'System Settings'. Two new properties, 'public_sharing' and 'publicdocs_allow_seo', are present under Lab Group Settings. Both start as DENIED.Published content does not require any authentication to be viewable - anyone with internet access will have a READ-ONLY view of published content. Publication generates a link to the public document which the publisher may chose to distribute as they wish.There is also a new 'Published' documents tab which is enabled in RSpace if you enable the 'public_sharing' property. The published documents page does not require any RSpace credentials to see. If your organisation blocks external access to RSpace, this page will be visible to anyone within your organisation (not just RSpace users). Otherwise, the published documents page is visible to any member of the public and will facilitate SEO. This page allows searching for public documents, using the search box 'By document or user'.The 'publicdocs_allow_seo' property determines whether users have the choice to allow public documents to be indexable by robots for SEO. It also determines if public documents are visible on the new 'Published' page. If the property is disabled, users have no choice and all published documents block SEO indexing. If the property is enabled, users may decide for themselves if they want documents to allow SEO or not.This property may be toggled but it does not take effect retrospectively. Therefore any documents published when the property was enabled (and their publishers decided to allow SEO), will have meta data allowing robots to index them and will be visible on the public documents page, even if the property is subsequently disabled. The converse is also true - documents published when the property was disabled will block SEO indexing and not be displayed on the 'Published' documents page, even if the property is subsequently enabled.DisablingThe 'public_sharing' property can be disabled by system admins or community admins. If this property is disabled by a community admin, the disabling effects described below will only apply to members of their communities. If disabled by a system admin, all users will experience the effects.Disabling the 'public_sharing' property has four consequences. Firstly, RSpace users no longer have a means to publish documents. Secondly, neither RSpace users or external users will be able to use any public links that have been created by publishing documents when the property was enabled. They will instead be redirected to a page informing them that publication has been disabled:Thirdly, disabling the 'public_sharing' property will hide the new 'Published' documents tab in the workspace. The 'Published' documents tab will also be hidden from members of the public if it is disabled by a sysadmin. It will not be hidden from members of the public if its is only disabled by a community admin.Fourth and finally, disabling the 'public_sharing' property will 'redact' data visible in the 'Published' documents page. Anyone could have bookmarked the actual 'Published' documents page and attempt to use a direct link. If they do so, they see a table of data with document names and summary text changed to the value 'Publication Disabled'.If 'public_sharing'  has been disabled by a system admin, then all data is redacted in this way. If disabled by a community admin, then only data published by a member of their communities is redacted.Re-enabling publishingYou may re-enable publishing - any links to public documents will now work again.Unpublishing published documentsSystem Admins may unpublish ANY published documents.Community Admins may unpublish ANY documents published by members of their communities.There are two ways to get to the page for unpublishing documents. Under the system tab, click on 'unpublish'. Or under the 'My RSpace' tab click on 'Users' Published Documents'.For details, see: Published Documents and Unpublishing DocumentsHow did we do?Related ArticlesPublished Documents and Unpublishing DocumentsPublication of DocumentsEnabling Publication of Documents in your Lab Group(opens in a new tab)Powered by HelpDocs(opens in a new tab)×ContactSend

Storing RSpace archives on S3 - RSpace Help                        Contact us                                              RSpace Website                      Contact                    All Categories                                    ​ > ​                    ​For System Administrators                  ​ > ​                                         Storing RSpace archives on S3                Storing RSpace archives on S3                            Updated 1 year ago                                                      by                            RSpace Support                          The following information is only applicable to an Enterprise instance of RSpace.This page explains how archive exports (HTML or XML) exports can be sent and stored to an AWS S3 bucket.BackgroundPreviously, when a user made an export of their work, it was stored on the RSpace server for a short time (usually 24 or 48 hours) and then deleted. The user received a link which enabled them to download the export to their own computer. This worked well for exports made for personal use, but is cumbersome if the purpose of the export is for long-term backup, or is a very large file.This new feature enables RSpace exports to be optionally sent to an S3 bucket.Export to S3In RSpace 1.69.45, archive exports can be configured to be sent to an |Amazon S3 bucket. The advantages are:S3's unlimited storage space and low cost mean that archives can be kept for much longer - potentially forever - and the lifecycle period is controlled by the bucket's owner, not RSpace.The archive files can be accessed directly from S3, as well as from an RSpace-generated link. This expands the potential for downstream processes to work with RSpace archive files.More efficient transport of large archives. Previously, to put an archive in an S3 bucket, you had to download the export to your computer, then upload to S3.Users can access their exports exactly as they have always done, via the RSpace-generated link.Current limitationsAll archives go to a single bucket. This feature doesn't yet support user-specified buckets.It's not yet possible to send a single archive file to multiple buckets at once.Setting up S3 export1. AWS credentialsIn order for RSpace server to be able to send exports to S3, the server needs permissions to access the S3 bucket. This can be accomplished by various AWS IAM mechanisms such as:An IAM role assigned to the instance (if RSpace is running on an AWS EC2 instance)Access credentials for an IAM identity, which are used by RSpace. This should be as restrictive a policy as possible, e.g. to the specific bucket. Here is an example minimum IAM policy:   "Version": "2012-10-17",              "Statement": [                  {                      "Sid": "VisualEditor0",                      "Effect": "Allow",                      "Action": [                          "s3:PutObject",                          "s3:GetObject",                          "s3:CreateBucket",                          "s3:ListBucket",                          "s3:HeadBucket",                          "s3:PutObjectAcl"                      ],                      "Resource": [                        "arn:aws:s3:::MyExampleBucket"                       ],                  }              ]          }          2.

In RSpace Team and RSpace Enterprise, the SysAdmin needs to create or assign a PI to a group.OverviewRSpace’s PI role is intended to represent the leader of a lab, a course leader, or anybody with responsibility for other people’s work. PIs can create their own content, just as a regular user can, but in addition can:Add and remove users from their groupAlter roles of people within their groupOrganise content that is shared within the groupView content created by group members: group members’ work is automatically shared with the PICreate collaboration groups with other PIsView and search the audit trail for work performed by group membersExport and archive their group’s workThese features are documented in:LabGroupsCollaboration GroupsViewing and Organising Shared Group ContentExamples of Sharing Scenarios and Project OrganisationExporting a LabGroup’s Workother articles in the PI documentationMuch of the day-to-day work and most of their powers and permissions can be delegated to LabAdmins (see The Lab Admin Role).If you want or need to act as both a PI and the RSpace system admin, which is not uncommon in small labs, you will need TWO different accounts and you should only log in as a Sysadmin if you need to perform admin tasks. Do not add production data when logged in as a Sysadmin, or Community Admin, do not add Admins to any LabGroups, and do not try to use Sysadmin account to fill the PI or standard user role.Viewing your LabGroup's workIn the Workspace toolbar, select the LabGroup records button. This filters your view to only display the Home folders of users who are members of your LabGroup, and the LabGroup shared folder. You have permissions to open and view these documents.If you regularly want to view the Home folders of a subset of users, you can favorite folders using the checkbox:And then use the toolbar's Favorites filter to view them.In RSpace Community Edition, anyone can designate themselves as a PI but in RSpace Team and Enterprise, PIs are created, revoked and assigned to LabGroups by the System Administrator (sysadmin). The sysadmin can also change the PI for a given LabGroup and adjust the group membership as needed.To change the PI within a group, the group must first have at least 2 members with the role of PI. If the group only has one member with the PI role, then that role must first be granted to at least one other memeber before the PI of the group can be changed by the sysadmin using the "change PI" button on the LabGroup page.Although a LabGroup can include several users with the role of PI, each LabGroup can only be led by a single PI. If your LabGroup needs more than one main administrator, the PI can promote other users to "LabAdmin with view all permission" also called a senior LabAdmin. The Senior LabAmins have almost all the same capabilities as the PI.How did we do?Related ArticlesExporting a LabGroup’s WorkPI-created "self-service" LabGroupsCreating and Managing LabGroups (for System Admins)(opens in a new tab)Powered by HelpDocs(opens in a new tab)×ContactSend

Members of your Lab Group may not by default publish anything.You may choose to allow members of your Lab Group to publish their own documents. This is enabled on the 'MyRSpace' -> 'My LabGroups' tab, then click 'Enable Group Publication'. Lab Group members may not publish documents shared with them. They may unpublish documents which they published themselves but not documents which they shared with you first and you subsequently published.You may choose to allow your Lab Group to have the option to allow their published documents be indexed for SEO. To do this click on 'Enable Published SEO'.You may disable group publication at any time. Doing so does not unpublish any documents published by group members. Published SEO may also be disabled at any time. It does not take effect retrospectively for any documents already published that have allowed SEO.Collaboration groupsAlthough collaboration groups may be used for document sharing, they are not intended to be used for the purposes of publishing documents. You may not enable group document publication for a collaboration group. Sharing a document with a collaboration group does not make it publishable, even if your PI is a member of the collaboration group. (Sharing explicitly with either your PI, or with your PI's Lab Group, will allow them to publish).How to publish, see Publication of DocumentsHow to unpublish, see: Published Documents and Unpublishing DocumentsIn depthPlease read the following which goes into more detail on the publication permissions. This is especially important if you have Lab Group members who are members of other Lab Groups as well.Summary of permissions to publish:Any PI can always publish their OWN documents.Any PI can unpublish a document published by a member of their group (Complication - publishing user may be in multiple Lab Groups). However, a PI can not unpublish when the publisher of the document is also a PI.When a document is shared with a PI via ‘share to user’ then the PI can publish the document if they are the PI of a group of which the sharing user is a member. (Complication - sharing user may be in multiple Lab Groups).When a document is shared with a PI via ‘share to group’ then the PI can publish the document if they are the PI of that group.By implication, if you allow a PI to join your Lab Group, they can publish their own documents and you cannot unpublish. However, they cannot normally publish documents shared with them by members of your Lab Group. They can only publish documents shared by members of your Lab Group if those members also belong to their Lab Group.There is a toggle switch ‘Enable Group Publication’, in each Lab Group, which ONLY the PI can toggle ON/OFF.When ‘enable group publication’ is toggled ON, any member of that Lab Group can publish their OWN documents. (Complication - members of this Lab Group may be in multiple Lab Groups, we will chose the most restrictive permissions in that case).There is a toggle switch, ‘Enable Published SEO’, in each Lab Group, which ONLY the PI can toggle ON/OFF. When ‘Enable Published SEO’ is toggled on, Lab Group members can choose to publish documents that allow SEO indexing. (Complication - members of this Lab Group may be in multiple Lab Groups, we will chose the most restrictive permissions in that case).Anyone can unpublish a document which they published. Users cannot unpublish documents they shared and were then published by the PI.When ‘enable group publication’ is toggled OFF, only PI can publish.Syadmins and community admins can unpublish any document.Collaboration groups have no bearing on publication, sharing a document with members of the collaboration group does not allow them to publish the document (even if they are PIs).Viewing public links There is a new “My Published documents” page which shows a table of published documents. Admins see this page as under a tab in MyRSpace: 'User's Published Documents'. PIs see a tab: 'My Group's Published Documents'. Lab Group members see a tab: 'My Published Documents'.Users get to see all of their documents which have been published in the new page.PIs get to see see all of their documents which have been published and all documents of members of groups (which they are the PI of) that have been published.Sysadmins get to see ALL published documents in the new page.Community admins get to see all documents published by members of their Community.Some examples of how it will work:I am a PI. I join your Lab Group as an ordinary member. The ‘Enable Group Publication’ toggle is turned OFF. I can publish my OWN documents. You cannot unpublish my publications.You can also publish and unpublish your own documents and documents shared with you by members of the Lab Group.A member of your group shares a document with me. I cannot publish it.I share a document with you. You can publish it.You share a document with me. I cannot publish it.A member of the Lab Group shares a document with the Lab Group. You can publish it, I cannot.A member of your Lab Group joins my Lab Group as well. They share a document with me. I can publish it.The same member shares a document with your Lab Group. You can publish it and I cannot.The same member shares a document with my Lab Group. I can publish it and you cannot.You join my Lab Group as an ordinary member. I can now publish the document your previously shared with me.Members of your Lab Group can not publish their own documents.Members of your lapGroup can see any documents they shared with you and you published in the new ‘My published documents page’. They cannot unpublish these documents.You turn on the ‘allow all to publish’ toggle. All members of your Lab Group can now publish their OWN documents.You can unpublish those publications by your group members. You cannot unpublish my publications, however.The member of your Lab Group who joined my Lab Group can no longer publish their OWN documents, even though you have turned on ‘enable group publication’ toggle for your Lab Group. This is because I have not enabled group publications in my Lab Group.A member of your Lab Group shares a document with another member - the sharee still cannot publish that, only the owner of the document.You decide to turn off the ‘Enable Group Publications’ toggle. Members of the Lab Group can no longer publish their OWN documents. They can, however, unpublish documents which they published while the toggle was turned on. You can also unpublish these.I can still publish my OWN documents.A collaboration group is created between my lab group and your Lab Group. I share a document with the collaboration group. This act of sharing does not grant anyone any new rights to publish the document.A member of the collaboration group that is also a member of my group, shares a document with the collaboration group. This does not grant me the permission to publish the document. Note that had that member shared with my lab group instead of the collaboration group, then I would have permission to publish the document.Publication permissions summaryRole in groupIs Group Publication Enabled?Can publish own/others docs?Visible published docs?Can unpublish?SysadminNANoneAllAllCommunity AdminNANoneAll published by a community memberAll published by a community memberGroup PINOOwn and docs shared with themDocs they published, and docs published by group membersDocs they published, and docs published by group members - unless publisher is a PIGroup member who is a PINOOwn docsDocs they own which are publishedDocs they publishedGroup memberNONoneDocs they own which are publishedDocs they publishedGroup PIYESOwn and docs shared with themDocs they published, and docs published by group membersDocs they published, and docs published by group members - unless publisher is a PIGroup member who is a PIYESOwn docsDocs they own which are publishedDocs they publishedGroup member (non PI)YESOwn docsDocs they own which are publishedDocs they published(Non PI) Group member who also belongs to a group with group publication disabledYESNoneDocs they own which are publishedDocs they publishedHow did we do?Related ArticlesPublication of DocumentsPublished Documents and Unpublishing DocumentsManaging published content(opens in a new tab)Powered by HelpDocs(opens in a new tab)×ContactSend

RSpace users can programmatically search, review and retrieve data in RSpace which in turn enables you to integrate RSpace into existing workflows with ease.The RSpace API enables programmatic search and retrieval methods for your documents. There are multiple GET methods for files and documents allowing for in-depth searches, the retrieval of complete documents and their metadata and the processing of data contained in forms.  There are also  POST methods to create new content and upload files.Where to find information on the API?The API is being continually expanded; please see the changelog for details.The latest public API documentation is always available on our Community site.An API tutorial, introducing the RSpace API, is available on our GitHub as well.The data model is a simplified version of RSpace's internal model.Tools and SDKsWe are developing rich language bindings and example code on our Github page for Python, Java and others.An open-source RSpace Command Line Interface (CLI) provides a convenient and compact way to access the API.Obtaining your API KeyRSpace uses API Keys for the authorisation and authentication. Please be sure to keep your API key confidential as it does provide limited access to your account. You can always regenerate or revoke your key. You can generate your API key in RSpace as follows:Login to RSpace and go to the ‘My RSpace’ pageClick on the ‘My Profile’ tileUnder the ‘Manage API key’ header, click on the ‘Regenerate key’ buttonA pop up box will appear asking you to enter your RSpace login passwordType your password and click ‘OK’If you look under the ‘Manage API key’ header, you will see your API key has been generated. You can now also see the option to revoke the key (to delete it).You may hide the key from view by clicking the ‘Hide Key’ link next to your key.API Key Authentication and Swagger DocumentationSwagger documentation for the RSpace API is available at http://<rspace_instance>/public/apiDocs (https://community.researchspace.com/public/apiDocs for community users).This documentation not only shows examples of requests you may with to make, but you can run real requests on your version of RSpace, following API key authentication.To authenticate your key and use Swagger to explore the API do the following:Go to the Swagger documentation for your instance of RSpace. This may be accessed by clicking on the ‘See API Documentation’ link in your RSpace profile (My RSpace > My Profile > under "Manage API key"), or alternatively at http://<rspace_instance>/public/apiDocs (for Community RSpace this is at https://community.researchspace.com/public/apiDocs)Click the ‘Authorize’ button on the Swagger page that opens, right below the introduction.Enter your current API key into the pop-up box provided and click ‘Authorize’You are now able to run requests via the Swagger interface. OAuth for RSpaceA tutorial for the initial implementation of OAuth with RSpace is available as part of our API Tutorial.API SecurityWe strongly urge you to keep your API key private. If using your API key on a shared computer, ensure it is not stored in a world-readable file.You may regenerate your API key at any time by clicking on the ‘Regenerate Key’ button. When your new key is generated, the old key will become invalidated.To block API access altogether you can simply click on the ‘Revoke Key’ button, to delete the API key.Both of these options can be found under My RSpace > My Profile, in the "Manage API key" section:Simple example using Apple Mac terminal to upload a file to the gallerySee youtube video here.You can try something similar using by downloading the ZIP file below and following the instructions in the readme file.Download .ZIP fileThis workflow can be useful for tasks such as automatically collecting files output by instruments and sending them automatically to RSpace.How did we do?Related ArticlesInventory API Introduction 🧪[Video] Introduction to RSpace[Video] 2 Minute RSpace Introduction(opens in a new tab)Powered by HelpDocs(opens in a new tab)×ContactSend

You can also create and edit forms.API AccessTo get set up to make an API call, a few conditions must be met:Your sysadmin has set the api.available setting to true – this is the default value, so the API should be available unless your sysadmin has turned it off.You have set up an API key in your RSpace profile page. Your API key is confidential and should not be disclosed publicly, as it gives limited access to your account. You can revoke or regenerate your key at any time. All API requests require setting an HTTP header 'apiKey’.API usage limitsThe rate of API calls you can make is currently limited, while we evaluate the performance impact of the API. The default rates are as follows:Default Limits per userMaximum 15 requests per 15 seconds.Maximum 1000 requests per hour.Maximum 5000 requests per day.Please allow at least 100ms between requests.Default Global limitsMaximum 75 requests per 15 seconds.Minimum interval of 25ms between requestsThere is no default global limit on number of requests per day or per hour.Setting custom usage limits:You can set custom usage limits for your RSpace installation using the following deployment properties. Any properties not set will remain as defaults.api.user.limit.day Maximum requests per user per dayapi.user.limit.hour Maximum requests per user per hourapi.user.limit.15s Maximum requests per user per 15sapi.user.minInterval Minimum interval between requestsapi.global.limit.day Maximum total requests per dayapi.global.limit.hour Maximum total requests per hourapi.global.limit.15s Maximum total requests per 15sapi.global.minInterval Minimum interval between requestsIf these limits are exceeded, you will receive a 429 TOO_MANY_REQUESTS error response.How did we do?Related ArticlesRound trip data analysis using Jupyter notebook and the RSpace APIIntroduction to configuring RSpace AppsApps Introduction(opens in a new tab)Powered by HelpDocs(opens in a new tab)×ContactSend

RSpace ELN Data modelThe RSpace ELN API data model contains all the elements present in the UI, but in a simpler form. The diagram shows the relations between the elements.Folders and Notebooks are containers for Documents. Gallery Folders contain Files. A document contains one or more Fields that contain the document's content and links to attached Files.The type and number of Fields is defined by a Form definition. A Form contains FormFields that define a Field.Documents, Notebooks, Folders, Forms and Files all have owners, that are Users (relation omitted for clarity on the diagram). Users can belong to one or more Groups; and their role within the group is stored in UserGroup objects.2. RSpace Inventory Data modelThe core data objects are Sample, Subsample and Container. A Sample is a description of a reagent, chemical or resource. A SubSample represents a physical item - e.g. a tube, vial or bottle - containing some Sample. A Container represents a storage unit such as freezer, box or shelf.All the core data objects can have arbitrary metadata associated with them using ExtraFields.Samples and Containers have an owner who is a User.Notes can be appended to Subsamples, recording observations or events.Different type of Container exist : List, Grid and Visual containers. Containers can contain nested containers (to any depth), or subsamples. The location of items in a Container is represented by ContainerLocation.Samples can have a defined list of SampleFields. The definition of a Sample is stored by a SampleTemplate. A SampleTemplate can represent a 'type' of Sample such as antibody, restriction enzyme, microscope slide etc.The diagram below shows the key relations. Not all properties are shown - please consult the API documentation for full details.How did we do?Related ArticlesRound trip data analysis using Jupyter notebook and the RSpace APIRSpace API IntroductionGitHub Integration(opens in a new tab)Powered by HelpDocs(opens in a new tab)×ContactSend

If you have a question you don’t see answered here, please get in touch through Intercom ("Chat with us" option in the help menu), or email us at support@researchspace.com.Getting StartedYou can use the question mark button on the bottom-right of an RSpace window to:browse help documentation articles and videos (the same content as https://researchspace.helpdocs.io/)search for specific articles using the searchbar at the bottom of the panelChat with us to message us directlyCheck out the Getting Started articleWatch an introductory video: 2 Minute RSpace Introduction and [Video] Introduction to RSpaceCommunity, Team and Enterprise Editionsmention communitiesWhat is the difference between RSpace Community, RSpace Team and RSpace Enterprise?See RSpace Community, Team and Enterprise EditionsWhat are RSpace servers/instances?They are separate deployments of the RSpace system. Community is the publicly available instance at https://community.researchspace.com/; each Team and Enterprise deployment has their own RSpace instance, usually at institution-name.researchspace.com.These instances are unable to communicate with each other, so make sure you are logging onto the right instance to form groups and share documents!How do I sign up to RSpace Community?You can sign up for an account at https://community.researchspace.com/signup. Once you sign up, you will need to open the link sent to your email account to verify who you are, you will then be able to log in.What is the difference between RSpace Community and Communities?RSpace Community is the free edition of RSpace, that provides full access to our ELN.Communities offer a flexible way to encompass multiple groups and labs inside of an RSpace instance. Communities can be based on an existing group of labs, such as a department, school, college, institute or other sub-institutional unit. They are useful to help spread the admin load of the system administrator in large deployments, by enabling them to delegate their work to Community Admins.My AccountI forgot my password, how can I reset it?On the login page, click the ‘Forgot password’ link. We’ll send you an email with a link that will take you to the password reset process.If you’ve forgotten your email as well, or entered an incorrect email address into your RSpace account, then please contact us or your RSpace administrator, who will be able to reset your email details.How can I change my email and or password?See My Profile and Authentication.Can I change my username?Your username is unique to you and used to track your revisions to work over time, so it is unfortunately not possible to change it.However, if you accidentally create an account with a misspelt  or erroneous username, the account can easily be deleted and a new one created with the correct username. Just ask your sysadmin (or contact us if you’re using RSpace Community).Can I create an account using the same email address?Emails associated with RSpace accounts need to be unique, so you will need to use a different email for a new account.I signed up using Google, but cannot login using the standard RSpace login?You can only access an account that was created using "sign up with Google" by using "log in with Google". You can always create a new account using the sign up tab if you wish to have a log in not tied to Google.Data EntryHow do I create a document?See Basic and Structured Documents.What’s the difference between a notebook and a folder?Folders in RSpace are just like folders on your computer, and they can have any depth and number of subfolders.Notebooks in RSpace are simplified folders that can only contain documents, not subfolders. You can share notebooks with other people, unlike folders. ‘Notebook view’ (accessible by clicking on the ‘Notebook’ icon in Workspace) facilitates easy navigation between sequential documents.See Notebooks, Sharing Folder or Gallery Contents, Sharing Content.Do you support chemical structure import and editing?Yes, you can draw and display chemical structures within RSpace, as well as import, search for, and export ChemDraw files. See ChemAxon & ChemDraw Integration.Can I add comments to documents?Yes, see "Comments" in The Text Editor.Why does my text look double-spaced?It is possible that you've been using the Enter (Return) key, which adds paragraph breaks, rather than Shift+Enter, which adds line breaks. Remembering to use Shift+Enter when returning to a new line should fix this issue.Pasting screenshots into a document is not working?Try saving your screenshot as a file and then drag it into an RSpace document.Icons in the document editor are not working?If you are using a laptop with touchscreen, see if changing the "mode" of the device from tablet/touch to laptop/mouse fixes this issue. If this doesn't help, please contact us.How do I add a published form to my Create menu?See "Add a Form to the Create Menu" in Forms.What is the Lucene query syntax?Lucene search is a means to perform powerful and complex queries in a single expression. See Advanced Search, or for full details, see the Lucene documentation.Data ManagementWhat are the provisions for researchers or institutions to extract their data from the system if they decide to discontinue use?One of the core architectural features of RSpace is the ability to get data out, at any time, in a variety of formats – Word, PDF, HTML, XML — and at every level of granularity from a single document to multiple documents to all work done by a lab to everything in the system. Individuals can export their own work, PI’s can export the lab’s work, and sysadmins can perform bulk export. In this way RSpace is designed to enable easy re-use of data outside RSpace, and to avoid vendor lock in in any way, shape or form.See Export Options, Export Formats, and Exporting a LabGroup’s Work for more information.Do you support regular automated exporting?We have written scripts that support programmatic scheduled exports of work at the lab level using the RSpace API, and we provide a feature to schedule bulk exports of data from RSpace to a repository designated by the institution with additional hashing to provide 100% certainty that the documents have not been altered after they left RSpace. All of this is under the institution’s control: you can establish the controls and SOPs you want about which kinds of user can perform which kinds of export.Or if you decide to terminate an account?On RSpace Community, for GDPR compliance, accounts are warned and then erased from the system after 12 months of inactivity.On RSpace Team and Enterprise, you control user management. We would never terminate an account; that is up to the institution. When a user account is deactivated the user can no longer access the system, but their data is retained. If you have a limited number of licenses, when an account has been deactivated another user can take that account, i.e. the licenses are reusable. In the case of a site license there is an unlimited number of accounts.Researchers are likely to have large amounts of data stored locally that they do not wish to move but would like to access via RSpace. Is this a possibility?RSpace supports connectivity with other data and file sources. This includes integrations with the most popular file sync and share apps, i.e. Box, Dropbox, Google Drive and One Drive (see Cloud Storage Integrations), and Egnyte, a super-secure solution that is widely used by biotechs.RSpace Enterprise also supports linking to lab and institutional file stores where typically big data — e.g. sequencing data and images — is already stored in a structured format (see Configuring Institutional File Systems). RSpace can communicate with file stores using common protocols like CIFS, Samba and DFS, and has a UI which permits the creation of these links and then the ability to search the folder structure and select an item to which a link can be made in an RSpace document. Each user can access the external files to which they have permission.How can I backup or export my documents from RSpace?You can export your data in PDF, .DOC (MS Word), HTML or XML format. Learn how to do so in Export Options.Can I migrate my work between different RSpace instances?Yes, please see Migrating Data from Community or Test Server to Enterprise.I just deleted a document by accident, how can I get it back?RSpace never actually deletes data from the server (in compliance with 21CFR11). See "Restoring Deleted Items" in Revisions and Deletions.I accidentally deleted some content, can I restore a previous revision?It is possible to restore any previous version of a document in RSpace, see Revisions and Deletions.How do I view previous versions of a document?See Revisions and Deletions.How can I automatically import images from my microscope server into RSpace?RSpace Enterprise customers can configure RSpace to communicate with their internal file-servers, enabling links to be made to images on your microscope servers. RSpace Community users have the options to either directly upload, or import from a URl, depending on how their images are accessible. (see The Gallery).How can I edit and update linked files in RSpace documents?To update a linked attachment:1. Firstly open the document containing the attachment in ‘Edit’ mode2. Then double-click on the link to the attachment to reveal the ‘Get Info’ button3. Click on the ‘Get Info’ button and then the ‘Replace’ button4. Select the file you wish to replace the currently linked file with.GroupsHow can I create a group?For RSpace Team and Enterprise, a system admin or RSpace admin will set up your LabGroup, see Creating Groups (for System Admins). For RSpace Community, anyone can create a group, see Creating a New LabGroup.What’s the difference between a collaboration group and a lab group?In a LabGroup, only your own PI can see your work by default. In a Collaboration Group, the other PI(s) can see work that you have explicitly shared with the group.​ If I’m in a collaboration group, can the other PI see my work? No, in a collaboration group, only people you actively share with can see your work.How do I invite new people to join a group?See "Add New Members to a LabGroup" in LabGroups.How can I remove myself from a group?See "Leaving or Removing a User from a LabGroup" in LabGroups.Can I belong to multiple groups?Yes, you can belong to any number of Lab Groups or Collaboration groups.I’m a PI and I’d like to see documents that users in my lab have added recently, how do I do this?See Viewing and Organising Shared Group Content, View and Search the Audit Trail.SharingHow do I share my work with other people?See Sharing Content.How do I share work with people who aren’t RSpace users?There are currently three ways to share with external parties:1. Export the desired file to HTML or PDF, and send it your collaborators via email or other preferred file sharing method. See Export Options and Export Formats.2. Publish PDF documents within RSpace and share URL. To do this, select a file in the PDF section of the Gallery, and click ‘Publish’. This generates a secure public URL that you can share. Additional authentication is not necessary for RSpace Community or Team users, but Enterprise customers may need to authenticate further if the RSpace server is behind a firewall. See Publishing PDFs & .DOC exports.3. Export the desired file to any of the repositories supported by RSpace (Dataverse, Figshare etc) by selecting ‘Export’ and then the ‘Repository’ option. See Dataverse Integration, Figshare Integration.How do I delete or rename a folder inside a shared LabGroup folder?Only the PI or LabAdmin of the LabGroup can delete or rename folders inside the shared folder. You can find more information in Making a User a LabAdmin and Viewing and Organising Shared Group Content.How do I add Word/PDF/other files to a shared folder?See Sharing Folder or Gallery Contents.How do I stop sharing a document with someone?See "Unsharing or Editing Permissions of a Shared Document" under Sharing Content.Who else can see my work?Within RSpace, the default setting is that only you and your PI can see your work. If you are a PI, your data is visible to you alone.I can't see my share or messaging buttons.Certain adblockers remove or hide buttons with "share" or "message" on them. Please either disable your adblocker or whitelist https://community.researchspace.com to continue to use these features.InventoryIs Inventory available to me?If you are an RSpace Team or Enterprise customer, Inventory is available to you at no extra charge. You should be able to see an "Inventory" tab in RSpace; please contact your RSpace System Administrator to upgrade to the newest RSpace version if the tab is not there.Please refer to RSpace Inventory Hub for more information.How much does Inventory cost?Inventory is free for Team and Enterprise customers. We will provide information for Community during 2022.Is there a way to try out Inventory?if you are a prospective customer or a Community user, you can get an idea of how Inventory will work by trying out our test instance, which is kept up-to-date with the newest features.Please refer to RSpace Inventory Hub for more information, and to access the test instance.IntegrationsWhat integrations are available in RSpace?See Integrations List & Availability for a full list of integrations and which RSpace editions they are available on.Can we integrate Box/Dropbox/GoogleDocs/OneDrive content into RSpace?Yes! See Cloud Storage Integrations (Google Drive, Dropbox, Box, OneDrive). If you don’t see these buttons, you’ll need to ask your RSpace administrator to enable these services. When you link to data in external files, the links will appear in your document.Note that in order to use these integrations, you must first enable them in the Apps panel (see Apps Introduction, or Introduction to configuring RSpace Apps for system administrators of Team and Enterprise servers).An integration doesn't seem to be working!As a first step, please check that the integration has been enabled. On RSpace Community, you can enable it yourself (see Apps Introduction); on Team and Enterprise, please ask your sysadmin to enable it.If the integration is enabled but still does not work, then something's wrong, please contact us with details!Privacy & SecurityHow do I know my work is secure?RSpace takes your data security seriously. All RSpace products use HTTPS to encrypt network connections, and passwords are stored securely. Access to the Community server is only granted to a select number of authorized Research Space employees. We work closely with RSpace Enterprise customers to ensure that RSpace interacts with institutional environments in a secure manner that suits their needs.Who else can see my work?Within RSpace, the default setting is that only you and your PI can see your work. If you are a PI, your data is visible to you alone. In exceptional circumstances, authorized RSpace administrators can access accounts, for example to investigate a user query or bug report. Please see our Privacy Policy for more details.Is RSpace 21CFR11 compliant?For both regulated labs and unregulated labs, RSpace is a crucial part of you overall compliance, Good Lab Practice, and patent protection strategy. 21CFR11 compliance has become the international “gold standard” for scientific data management and should be considered mandatory for any modern, efficient, paperless lab. The key elements of 21CFR11 that are supported by RSpace are as follows:- Data is true and accurate record of your work.- Ability to create accurate copies and human readable exports for inspection.- Limited, secure, role-based access by authorized individuals only.- Secure audit trail that records all user actions with computer generated timestamps.- All changes are visible, older versions remain available for inspection.- All records remain available in the system for the period of the study (i.e. permanently for most academic labs).- Training in proper use of the system is available and completed by all users.- Digital signatures can be used to lock documents and signatures cannot be separated from the data they safeguard.- Proper password management procedures, system security and access / activity logging are all part of the system.For the highest level of compliance, you lab procedures will need to be professionally validated in-situ by qualified specialists. Research Space can assist you with every step of this process. For more information about 21CFR11 compliance see: http://www.fda.gov/ICECI/EnforcementActions/default.htmWhat is your privacy policy?Please refer to our Privacy Policy page.StorageWhere is my data stored?Any content you create in a document or notebook is stored in the RSpace database. Files and images you upload to RSpace are stored unaltered on the RSpace server.  At any time you can export some or all of your data to HTML, PDF or XML format to get all your data out of RSpace (see Export Options).RSpace Enterprise customers choose whether RSpace is installed on premises, on a cloud they manage, or on a cloud we manage in a location of their choice. RSpace Team customers are deployed on a cloud we manage in a region of their choice. The data their users enter into RSpace is therefore stored in the country or region in which they are located. RSpace Community is deployed on an AWS server we manage in Ireland.Are there storage limits?Users of RSpace Enterprise and RSpace Team do not have storage space or upload file size limits, unless their institution decides to configure a limit.Users of RSpace Community have access to unlimited storage space as well, but there is a 10MB limit on individual uploads.TechnicalDo you have an API?Yes, we do. You can create, search, share and export content. See our API developer docs for details.When is your scheduled downtime?We do not expect any downtime other than when we’re releasing a new version, approximately once every month.  In the event of any unscheduled downtime, you will receive a notification that allows plenty of time for you to save your work and logout before the application is restarted.How did we do?Related ArticlesGetting Started with RSpace ELNSaaS Backup ProceduresTeaching Licenses & Education server(opens in a new tab)Powered by HelpDocs(opens in a new tab)×ContactSend

Choosing AND returns a set of results which match both the first filter AND the second (removing any which only match one); choosing OR returns a set of results which match either one filter OR the other (i.e. including all results which match one or other of the filters or which  match both).Annotation – Written notes which can be added to instances of images when editing an RSpace document. The original image remains in the Gallery and can be used elsewhere, the annotation remains part of the document, and can be edited by anyone with permission like any other content.Audit Trail – Users’ actions in RSpace can be viewed, selected from and reviewed by themselves, their PI and system administrators. The auditing mechanism (located in My RSpace) gives scope of what you can audit according to roles and permissions.AV Gallery: Audiovisual gallery – The audiovisual section of the gallery in RSpace is where you can import and organize audio and video files.Asc/Desc button – The Asc/Desc button allows documents of all types to be sorted in ascending/descending order.BBasic Document – the simplest document you can create in RSpace, the Basic Document is an open-input single field document which you can freely add text, images, links, etc to without using any field structures or building multiple pages or chapters. See Structured Documents for use of defined field structures, and Notebooks for how to create content over multiple pages, documents and sections. Notebooks are built from Entries, which can be made from either basic or structured documents as required.Box – When available (dependent on institutional policies), RSpace allows integration with a number of external file storage and management systems including some public cloud services. Box is one such service which is supported.CCloud RSpace – see RSpace CommunityCollaboration Group – A collaboration group in RSpace consists of two or more LabGroups, and enables some or all users from each LabGroup to work together.Community – A Community in RSpace is a group of LabGroups within a single RSpace deployment. Note that this is distinct from RSpace Community, which is a version of RSpace itself (see RSpace Community).DDirectory – In RSpace, ‘The Directory’ is a listing (found under the My RSpace tab) of users, groups and communities in that RSpace instance. In RSpace Community, the users are not displayed as a list, but are available as a search-based resource to find users by know criteria.Documentation – Documentation in RSpace refers to the written portion of our Help and Support resources.Dropbox – When available (dependent on institutional policies), RSpace allows integration with a number of external file storage and management systems including some public cloud services. Dropbox is one such service which is supported.EExternal Filestore –> see FilestoreFFilestore/Filesystem – Many institutions which use RSpace may already have established methods and locations for file storage. Some may have multiple, named filestores on a single system, accessed by permission, and others may have multiple systems, each containing many stores. Institutional RSpace users can set up connections to both stores within a system, and multiple systems, and save the connections as quick access links in their Gallery.Form – In RSpace, a ‘Form’ is a particular kind of re-usable starting point for a document which can be created by users and made available for use. Essentially, a form defines an empty structure of named fields to be used for creating structured documents with a consistent form or structure. Once made, a form can be published for individual use, made available to a group, or be open to anyone. Users can add available forms to their ‘Create’ menu to be able to instantly make new documents based on the form.GGallery – The RSpace Gallery is a storage and management area for files and documents which can then be used in RSpace documents – whilst the Workspace is a view and manage area for documents created in RSpace, while the Gallery is for all kinds of files which are either brought in from outside (such as images, videos, spreadsheets, etc) or  can be taken out of RSpace (such as PDFs). The exception to this is the Snippets and Templates Galleries, which are created and used within RSpace. The Gallery is categorised by file types, and files dragged directly into documents are placed into the Gallery and can be re-used elsewhere. Also, if linking to external file stores is enabled, these external file locations will be found in a File Stores section in the Gallery.Google Drive – When available (dependent on institutional policies), RSpace allows integration with a number of external file storage and management systems including some public cloud services. Google Drive is one such service which is supported.HIInstitutional RSpace –> see RSpace EnterpriseJKLLabAdmin – A Lab admin is a group-specific role in RSpace. Lab admins have a global User role but can invite new users, remove existing group members, and organize the LabGroup shared folder. LabAdmins cannot view all group members’ documents (only the PI can do that).List View (see also Tree View) – List view is the default view in Workspace, and shows a paginated list of all documents. Workspace filters can be used for further navigation of shared or favorited documents.MMarvin JS / ChemAxon – Marvin JS is a chemical editor that allows users to easily draw and edit chemical structures and formulae within RSpace documents.NOPPermissions – Permissions in RSpace refer to the different kinds of access users can have to documents. View permission can be thought of as read-only access: a user can view a document, but cannot make any changes to it. Edit permission means that a user has access View permission by default, as well as being able to make changes to the document.PI: Principal Investigator – Users with the PI role in RSpace can be the leader of a lab, a course leader, or anybody with responsibility for other people’s work. They have all the same capabilities as regular users, but in addition they can add and remove users from their group, alter user roles within their group, organize shared content, view content created by group members, create collaboration groups with other PIs, view and search the audit trail for work performed by group members, and export and archive their group’s work.QRRequest – A Request in RSpace can take two forms. Most commonly, requests are for access to documents. A basic request can be accomplished by sending a message directly to a user. A request can also be made by a PI user to another PI to create a Collaborate Group.Revision History – The Revision History of a document shows the state of the document each time it was changed from its creation to the most current version. It is possible to both view and restore previous document versions from the revision history.RSpace Community – RSpace Community is a the free-to-use, publicly available version of RSpace, which is hosted on a cloud-based server allowing anyone to sign up and become a user.RSpace Enterprise – RSpace Enterprise is a stand-alone deployment version of RSpace provided to a closed community of users in a single institution or location. The version has some functionality unique from the Community version (particularly around administration, group creation and sharing) and can be run on the institution’s own servers or on a unique cloud instance.RSpace Team - RSpace Team is for academic and commercial customers that want administrative control over their RSpace instance and access to RSpace Inventory, but do not require all the features of Enterprise such as SSO or an on-premises deployment.SSigning – The owner of a document in RSpace can use the signing mechanism to mark it as complete. A signed document can still be viewed by anyone with permission to view it, but it is closed for editing.Snippet – A Snippet in RSpace is fragment of content from a text field that a user wishes to reuse in their subsequent work. Snippets are stored in their own section of the Gallery.Structured Document – A structured document is a document with multiple fields, with each field designed for a specific type of content. Users can configure the fields to suit their needs.Structural Formula – A structural formula refers to any type of chemical structure or formula in RSpace. Structural formulae can be drawn and edited using the Marvin JS tool from within the text editor.TTemplate – An RSpace template allows users to reuse the structure of a document without necessarily replicating the entire contents. For example, templates can be very useful when recording results of multiple experimental iterations.TinyMCE – TinyMCE is the text editor used in RSpace.Tree View (see also List view) – The Tree View in the Workspace is a way of viewing a the folder structure and organization of documents. Clicking on any folder name expands it to show contents and subfolders within the tree.UVVersioning – Versioning in RSpace allows users to view and restore previous versions of documents at will. This can be accomplished by selecting a document and clicking ‘Revision History’.WWitnessing – Witnessing a document in RSpace is similar to signing, but is an added layer of verification of the document’s completeness by another user (either the LabGroup PI, or another contributor from the group with access to the document).Workspace – The Workspace is the default point of entry in RSpace, and it is from here that users can create, view, edit, share, and organize all document types. It is accessible throughout the application from the Workspace tab.XYZHow did we do?Related ArticlesResearchSpace Inventory manager (RSINV) GlossaryGetting Started with RSpace ELNSetting up Single Sign-On Authentication(opens in a new tab)Powered by HelpDocs(opens in a new tab)×ContactSend

The following comparison table provides a high-level overview of the feature differences; the next sections go into more depth on the benefits of each edition. We indicate in the documentation if a feature is only available in a specific edition of RSpace, so don't worry about remembering!Information on subscription costs is available on our pricing page, and details on integration availability are at Integrations List & Availability.CommunityTeamEnterprise✔ Fully-featured ELN✔ Shared cloud instance✔ Access to a large number of integrations✔ Limited data and audit trail retention period for inactive users✔ Fully-featured ELN✔ Private AWS instance in the supported regional data center closest to you✔ RSpace Inventory✔ Access to even more integrations✔ Basic training✔ System administrator role and features✔ Hierarchical tiered admin✔ Unlimited data and audit trail retention period✔ Fully-featured ELN✔ Your choice between an on-premises deployment, or a private AWS instance in a location of your choice✔ RSpace Inventory✔ Access to all integrations✔ Comprehensive training✔ Unlimited teaching licenses at no extra cost✔ SSO support through SAML2 (Shibboleth) and LDAP (Active Directory)✔ System administrator role and features✔ Hierarchical tiered admin✔ Unlimited data and audit trail retention period✔ Co-branding✔ HIPAA compliance (additional charge)RSpace CommunityRSpace Community is free to use and is open to any type of user. Anyone can sign up for RSpace Community, and create groups with users in their lab, with other labs in their institution, and with labs in other institutions. It’s completely free for both individuals and groups, and data storage is also free. Because of GDPR regulations, data in active accounts cannot be retained indefinitely, so Community edition may not be suitable for groups who need long-term data management. If you ultimately purchase or gain access to a Team or Enterprise server, you can migrate your data to that new server and request that your old account on Community be deleted.RSpace Community Edition is not to be confused with the concept of a "Community" within a given RSpace server. A Community is a collection of LabGroups that represent some logical division of your organization and is used in larger deployments to facillitate delegated, hierarchic administration.RSpace TeamRSpace Team is for academic and commercial customers that want administrative control over their RSpace instance and access to RSpace Inventory, but do not require all the features of Enterprise such as SSO or an on-premises deployment.RSpace EnterpriseRSpace Enterprise is designed for use at research institutions: universities, public research institutes and private companies. In addition to the core functionality present in RSpace Community, RSpace Enterprise provides additional institutional support:Sysadmin control & multi-tiered adminAbility to create and administer Communities, which are groups of LabGroups, e.g. you could have a Community for the Department of Chemistry, another one for the Center for Brain, Biology, and Behavior etc., and each of these units would have a Community admin capability.Single Sign-On integrationLinks to institutional and lab-based file storesIntegration with institutional repositories and archives and other infrastructureInstalled on a private server of your own that can be on-premises or hosted by usOption to have us manage server for you or restrict all access to only your own staffAccess to RSpace Inventory at no additional costOption to set up an education server that teachers and students can use without limits, at no extra costDeployment detailsFor more information about on-site installs and the technical requirements of RSpace Enterprise, please contact us at support@researchspace.com. We look forward to hearing from you! You can also browse technical details here and see our system requirements here.Migrating to another editionIf you want to try RSpace on the free Community edition and later migrate to your own Team/Enterprise edition server, then each user can export and seamlessly import all their data from one server to another.If you are familiar with RSpace from the Community edition, you should have no trouble using RSpace Team or Enterprise; the way they work is very similar, with a few key areas that have notable differences, such as access to RSpace Inventory and its integration with the ELN, sharing and collaboration mechanisms, and the way that LabGroups are created, modified and managed. We indicate in the documentation if a feature differs in how it works across editions or if it's only available in a specific version. It is not possible to migrate digital signatures or full audit history from one server to another. Although many small academic labs and some small commercial organizations use RSpace Commumity edition as long-term, no-cost solution, the limitations of signature / audit migration, the necessary limits on data retention for inactive users, and the lack of your own "sysadmin" account mean that if stringent intellectual property protection and regulatory oversight is important to your organization, you should use the Community edition ONLY as a way to try the product. For stringent or regulated commercial organizations, we always recommend starting with Team/Enterprise server right away so that all production data is kept in a single, fully compliant and centrally managed environment.How did we do?Related ArticlesFAQRoles and Capabilities (for Team & Enterprise)Creating a New LabGroup on the Community Edition server(opens in a new tab)Powered by HelpDocs(opens in a new tab)×ContactSend

The responsibility and privilege of protecting your identity and scientific information is our first priority and our team is committed to making this happen.The RSpace web application follows OWASP guidelines and Oracle Cert Secure Coding standards and is continuously tested for security flaws. Our development processes consider the security impact for all new features and improvements.ResearchSpace has SOC 2 - Type 2 unqualified certification , SOC 2 Type 2 unqualified report indicates the auditors didn’t find anything below the standards set by the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants (AICPA) Trust Service Criteria (formerly the Trust Service Principles).SOC 2 Type 2 is an auditing procedure highly adopted by cloud-based service providers by the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants (AICPA). This ensures a standard degree of security control in areas including organization and management, communications, risk management, monitoring of controls, and more. Meeting this milestone addresses critical compliance requirements of Research Spaces diverse and global customer base. It examines a service provider’s internal controls and systems related to security, availability, processing integrity, confidentiality, and privacy of data.This means RSpace has maintained the highest level of requirements within the industry to further protect and secure customer data and the availability of its product. The full SOC2 report can be made available to customers on signing of a Non-disclosure Agreement.For hosted customers, RSpace uses Scalable Storage in Cloud provided by Amazon Web Services.  Amazon stores data in highly secured data centers, which utilize state-of-the-art electronic surveillance and multi-factor access control systems. Data centers are monitored 24/7 by trained security guards and their access is authorized strictly on a least privileged basis.For on-premises customers, RSpace integrates smoothly into your environment, supporting both SAML2 and LDAP-based user authentication. RSpace can be fully installed and managed by customer IT staff, if it is required that no access be permitted to Research Space staff.The following sections explain some of the security procedures and strategies used to keep users’ data and details secure.We regularly commission penetration testing from an accredited specialist security testing company. These are week-long tests incorporating both manual and automated testing. We are happy to share the latest report with prospective and current customers on request.Supply chain securityRSpace software comprises bespoke code written in-house, open-source third-party libraries and a small number of commercial third-party libraries.In-house code is reviewed for secure coding practices during code-review stage. Source code development is conducted entirely in-house and is not sub-contracted.RSpace source code is stored on Github, and therefore benefits from Github's automated vulnerability scanning of dependent libraries. If a vulnerability is detected with a known fix, a Pull Request with a recommended fix is auto-generated and the development team notified. In this way, vulnerabilities in our dependencies can be detected and addressed as part of the Software Development Lifecycle. New libraries can be vetted for known security defects before going into production.For commercial libraries, we receive security advisories directly as part of our service agreement and update accordingly.Password securityIn ‘stand-alone’ mode (i.e. not using an institution’s SSO mechanism to authenticate users), RSpace maintains its own authentication mechanism and credentials database.Passwords created by the user must be at least 8 characters long, not be identical to the username, and not belong to a common password blacklist (e.g., ‘password’).Passwords are salted with a unique 16 byte prefix generated by a cryptographically secure random number generator and hashed, before persisting to the database. In this way the plaintext password is never stored, and, in the event of the password table becoming compromised, it is not immediately susceptible to dictionary or rainbow table attacks.To prevent brute-force password guessing attacks, accounts are locked out for a short time after a number of consecutive unsuccessful logins. All login attempts are logged to a security event log.Auto-completion of input fields is disabled for login and signup pages.We also recommend that for admin role accounts, end-users follow good practice by disabling password-storing in their browsers.After logout, sensitive pages are not cached in the browser.Plain-text passwords are never emailed to the user as a result of password reset / forgotten password workflows.Any credentials used by Research Space staff to access customer servers in an administrative or maintenance role are always unique, long, securely-random, and managed in a secure vault with access restricted to operational personnel.If RSpace is deployed in an institution using SSO, then it is the institution’s Identity Provider's responsibility to safeguard passwords and login credentials.Network securityRSpace must run over a secure HTTPS connection which encrypts the communication channel between client and server, and also verifies the identity of the endpoint by SSL certificates issued by a recognized Certification Authority.Database securityNo direct access to the database is possible by end-users or from outside an RSpace deployment's internal network.All SQL queries use Prepared Statements to defend against malicious user input.The database itself is not encrypted, but OS-level encryption can be used if necessary.The RSpace database client runs using limited permissions.Resource AuthorizationPrivacy of the user’s content depends on RSpace's authorization policy. All access to ELN entries or resources requires authenticated access by default, and URL paths are protected by user roles. At a fine-grained level, access to individual records is controlled by a combination of Access Control Lists (ACLs) and user-specific permissions. Every action (e.g., Read, Edit, Delete, Export, Copy) is authorized at the server level before proceeding - RSpace does not solely rely on controlling the actions available in the UI, as these may be circumvented by URL-guessing attacks.For example, a user has authorization to edit content created by him/herself, but must be granted permission to access content created by other members of his/her group. To access content created outside a lab group, all PIs or RSpace managers of the groups concerned must accept the sharing request. Otherwise, the content is not accessible. A request to view a record, for example at '/notebook/view/123/' will check for the authenticated user's permission to access record 123 before proceeding.For more coarse-grained permissions - for example, global admin permissions - we use Role Based Access Control (RBAC) to restrict the available functionality to the user’s role.Defence against malicious useWe are guided by OWASP's guidelines on securing web applications and aim to be at least level 1 compliant in their Application Security Verification Standard (ASVS). Here, we briefly enumerate our policies in the following Control areas:Authentication & session management (A2)Failed logins give no information about reason for failure.Sensitive information is never included in URLs.Users are informed at each login when their last login was, so they can see if anyone has impersonated them since their last session.A security event logs all login attempts.To minimize brute force attacks, accounts are temporarily locked after 4 unsuccessful logins.RSpace uses secure random number generators to generate session keys.Sessions expire after a short time of inactivity. Users performing sensitive operations must re-authenticate at the time of the operation (e.g., password resets, signing documents, etc).Browser caching - Our policy in this are is guided by OWASP’s guidelines at (https://wiki.owasp.org/index.php/Testing_for_Logout_and_Browser_Cache_Management_(OWASP-AT-007)). In brief, sensitive data such as login pages, signup pages, user profile pages, and any pages only accessible to a ROLE_ADMIN or ROLE_SYSADMIN are returned from the server with HTTP headers set to prevent browser caching. When a user logs out (or his session expires due to inactivity) the session is invalidated, and clicking on the browser’s ‘Back’ button will trigger a reload from the server for these pages, which will redirect to the login page.Authorization of resourcesAccess to resources is controlled by a combination of Role Based Access Control and instance-based permissions (Access Control Lists).Cross-Site Request ForgeryOnly same-origin POST requests are permitted.Cross-site scriptingAll user input submitted to the server is filtered before being sent back to the client for display. Client side libraries use ‘safe’ Javascript methods to manipulate user input - e.g., jQuery’s text() method.InjectionAll user input is validated for erroneous or malicious input.Exclusive use of prepared statements guards against SQL injection attacks.Current libraries (A9)We regularly update libraries and 3rd party software components to ensure the latest security fixes are in place - see Supply Chain section above.Security event loggingAll security events are logged to a dedicated Security log whose output can be consumed by a SEM tool.Revision history and audit trailThe revision history records all changes made to research records over time. RSpace keeps a full record of this, including timestamps. The audit trail records events on the system - document edits and updates are recorded.Testing and auditsCREST-accredited independent penetration testers regularly evaluate RSpace, using manual and automated methods. The latest test was March 2023. We are happy to discuss findings with customers or serious potential customers.If you wish to speak to us about any security related matters, please email security@researchspace.comVulnerability Disclosure ProgramRSpace follows industry standards, adopting the use of "security.txt (https://securitytxt.org/)".

Three key ones are discussed below – actual loss of data, practical loss of data, and failure to record data. Using RSpace, or any other electronic lab notebook, can help protect against loss of data but can only ever be part of a broader solution which includes the broader IT environment and lab practices. Actual loss of data This could arise from loss of backups, outage, disk failure, or malicious deletion. RSpace is deployed on a server that is owned and maintained by Information Services, which ensures regular maintenance and provides regular backups. Malicious deletion is not possible because no data entered into RSpace is actually ever deleted.  Data marked for deletion is simply hidden, and can always be restored.Practical loss of data This could happen when data exists, but its location is unknown, or it is inaccessible. This problem is greatly reduced by using an electronic recording system like RSpace. RSpace provides a whole range of utilities which can be used to effectively find data whose location is unknown, including a powerful and fine grained search function, the ability to create folders which can be displayed in tree or list views, and an audit trail that records all actions taken and can be searched using various parameters.Failure to record dataThis is a procedural issue for lab management, and can occur with paper or electronic recording systems.How did we do?Related ArticlesHow RSpace Can Help Prevent FalsificationSharing Data with non-RSpace Users[Video] Chemistry Data Sheets in RSpace(opens in a new tab)Powered by HelpDocs(opens in a new tab)×ContactSend

Compliance with the US Food and Drug Administration’s Title 21 CFR part 11 (21CFR11) is the international standard for scientific data management, and RSpace is no exception. The key elements of 21CFR11 that are supported by RSpace are as follows:Data is true and accurate record of your work.Ability to create accurate copies and human readable exports for inspection.Limited, secure, role-based access by authorized individuals only.Secure audit trail that records all user actions with computer generated timestamps.All changes are visible, older versions remain available for inspection.All records remain available in the system for the period of the study (i.e. permanently for most academic labs).Training in proper use of the system is available and completed by all users.Digital signatures can be used to lock documents and signatures cannot be separated from the data they safeguard.Proper password management procedures, system security and access / activity logging are all part of the system.For the highest level of compliance, your lab procedures will need to be professionally validated in-situ by qualified specialists. The team at Research Space can assist you with every step of this process.How did we do?(opens in a new tab)Powered by HelpDocs(opens in a new tab)×ContactSend

To begin with, only people in your Labgroup can enter and see your group’s data, making it impossible for unauthorised parties to tamper with the lab’s data.  It would of course be possible for someone in the lab to enter false or falsified data into RSpace If this were to happen, because of RSpace’s audit trail, a record would be automatically be kept of the person making the entry and the time it had been made.  It would also be possible for someone in the lab to falsely revise an existing data entry if they had edit permission on the relevant record. Again, the audit trail would keep a record of who made the revision, when it was made and the changes that had been made.  Through the audit trail and using the search function it would be straightforward to investigate suspected cases of falsification and if one had occurred to identify who was involved.How did we do?Related ArticlesHow RSpace Can Help Prevent Data LossLeaving RSpaceDeploying RSpace(opens in a new tab)Powered by HelpDocs(opens in a new tab)×ContactSend

Colleagues within the institution with an SSO account will automatically be able to access the link to see the record being shared.It is possible to publish records that have been exported as a PDF/.DOC file. This will generate a stable URL that can then be shared with external parties, which do not need to be authenticated into RSpace to access the record. They will be able to see a read-only version of the record by clicking on the link.You can learn how to publish PDFs/.DOC files in Archiving and Export, and how to export data in Export Options and Export Formats.In RSpace version 1.81 and higher it is also possible to grant non-RSpace users direct access to selected work within RSpace using the new publish feature.You can also make work available to non-RSpace users by exporting your work directly to a suitable repository and making it public there.

You can find some general advice about on-prem backups here. We will consult with your IT personnel at the time of deployment. For backing up AWS-based RSpace instances, Research Space uses scripts to automate the backup process that we are happy to share with customers on request. When deployed as SaaS, Research Space take full responsibility for the durability and accuracy of stored data.Data Storage and Backup FrequencyData is stored in a MySQL 5.7 or MariaDB10.3 database; files are stored unmodified on EBS volumes in a directory structure. The sorts of backups made are:We make hourly file syncs to S3 using AWS CLI toolNightly and weekly snapshots of instances and data volumes are stored as machine images (AMIs). These are fast to make, and support RTOs in the order of minutesLogical database backups are made nightly, and stored on S3. Data Files, logs, configuration files and search indices are additionally synced to S3 hourly. This process ensures a completely separate, independent storage for research data, at the cost of longer recovery times. AWS S3 has extremely high durability (eleven 9s—see https://aws.amazon.com/s3/faqs/) and serves as a backup of last resortData LocationData backups are at the location of the AWS region selected by the customer at time of installation, or geographically closest to the customer, if no specific region has been designated.What is included in the backupAll of these are backed up regularly (at least nightly):The MySQL/MariaDB RSpace databaseThe RSpace filestoreLog filesRSpace configurationRecovery TestingRecovery of AMI snapshots is tested weekly using an automated procedure to ensure all data is recovered and database integrity is maintained, and that RSpace launches successfully.The Disaster Recovery procedure from S3 backups is tested twice-yearly.Retention & Deletion of DataData would remain in S3 backups and EBS snapshots until the backup expires (typically 3 weeks).For all deployment options, specific requests to permanently delete individual items of data can be made on a case-by-case basis.Customer Copy & API OptionsIf the customer has an AWS account, database and filestore backup AMIs and/or S3 buckets can be copied to your AWS account.Additionally, we offer optional, redundant, automated / scheduled total data export options via our modern API to any repository or other destination of your choice.How did we do?Related ArticlesDeploying RSpaceHow RSpace Can Help Prevent Data LossRSpace 1.69.33 Update Notes(opens in a new tab)Powered by HelpDocs(opens in a new tab)×ContactSend

Before installing or updating any on-premise RSpace server, always refer to the version-specific .md documentation files included with the download bundle for that version. Contact ResearchSpace for the download URL.In RSpace 1.69.33 we are implementing a series of database refactorings to move image files out of the database and into the RSpace file-store.This will bring several advantages:The database will be much smaller, making backup and recovery much faster.More of the database will be able to be held in memory, resulting in better performance.The refactoring will occur in several steps, starting with 1.69.33. This initial step will copy files from the database to the RSpace file-store, but not delete them from the database.Before updating to 1.69.33, please read the following procedure, and contact Research Space if you have questions or concerns.Planning steps before updating to 1.69.33The code snippets below may have to be adjusted for your own database name, credentials and paths.1. Run some database queries to assess how much data will be migratedmysql -uusername -p rspacemysql> select count(*) from EcatImage;mysql> select count(*) from EcatDocumentFile;If you have less than 10 000 (ten thousand) each of these items, the upgrade will be unlikely to produce any resource issues, and you can disregard step 2.If you do have more, please do the following:2. Making sure you have sufficient resources for the migration Check if binary logging is enabled: mysql> show variables like '%log_bin%';If it’s on, turn it off by commenting out the following line in /etc/mysql/mysql.conf.d/mysqld.cnf:#log_bin = /var/log/mysql/mysql-bin.logDisabling binary logging will prevent the generation of enormous log files and speed up the migration process. Ensure enough space for MySQL tmpdir. The default location is /tmp. If the temp folder is on the same drive as the main data folder no change should be needed.mysql> show variables like 'tmpdir';If you've edited any MySQL variables in the configuration file, restart MySQL before starting the migration.Look in your MySQL data directory to see the size of the ImageBlob.frm table, eg. sudo ls -lrt /var/lib/mysql/rspacePlease ensure there is at least 5x this capacity available on the system before starting.Increase Java heap size if need be in /etc/default/tomcat8. In JAVA_OPTS variable, edit -Xmx to a value at least 2048m.If -Xmx is not set, there is no need to set it - Java memory will scale to the available system memoryPerforming the update to 1.69.33We recommend setting up a maintenance window of 30 minutes; in most cases the migration will complete sooner.If you have more than 10000 images in the database, check that MySQL variables are set correctly (see preparatory steps above).Note the version of RSpace you are currently using (in case you have to revert).Stop the RSpace server. Copy the existing .war application file to backup:sudo cp /var/lib/tomcat8/webapps/ROOT.war ~/rsp-pre169-33.warEither make a cold image snapshot, or a logical mysql database dump:mysqldump -uusername -p rspace --single-transaction --ignore-table rspace.ImageBlob_AUD --ignore-table rspace.FieldAutosaveLog > rspac-pre169-33.sqlUpdate RSpace as usual. The migration runs asynchronously, after RSpace starts up. Users can access RSpace while the migration is running, although performance may be reduced. The migration is complete when you see a log line similar to INFO /12/14 18:46:liquibase: Successfully released change log lock appearing for the second time. Depending on the speed of your disk, expect to be able to migrate about 30000-40000 files per hour. If RSpace crashes or runs out of memory, restart RSpace - it will continue the migration from where it left off. If it repeatedly runs out of memory, increase the available heap size (step 2.6).Post-migration stepsRestore MySQL binary logging, if was previously enabled (in step 2.2).Asserting the migration workedAll these queries should return an empty result set.select count(*) from failedImgWorkingConversions;select count(*) from assertImgWorkingSize where blobLength != fpSize;select count(*) from failedImgThumbnailConversions;select count(*) from assertImgThumbnailSize where blobLength != fpSize;select count(*) from assertThumbnailSize where blobLength != fpSize;select count(*) from assertDocThumbnailSize where blobLength != fpSize;select count(*) from assertDocThumbnailSize where blobLength != fpSize;How did we do?Related ArticlesChangelog - what's new?Creating a Backdoor Login AccountUsing multiple RSpace accounts with the same SSO identity(opens in a new tab)Powered by HelpDocs(opens in a new tab)×ContactSend

It is only suitable for small deployments with low throughput (e.g. less than 5 documents per minute). We recommend the Docker installation for larger deployments.Document previewsA separate application is used to generate document previews of Office/OpenOffice documents. If the application is not installed, then these previews will not be available to user.To install, download the application from the RSpace download site:wget --user=<username> --password=<password> https://operations.researchspace.com/software/aspose/aspose-app-VERSION.zipreplacing VERSION with the current release version and using your download credentials in place of <username> and <password>. As of April 201. Unzip and follow the installation instructions in the file Usage.md. Here we assume you are putting the application in /etc/rspace/aspose.2. Make sure the application has executable permissions:chmod 755 /etc/rspace/aspose/aspose-app.jar3. There are several deployment properties relating to document preview generation. These three are mandatory.

This test asserts that the file store exists and can be written to from RSpace.2. Create a documentIn workspace, click Create -> Basic Document and wait for a new document to appear. This tests database configurationlicense setup (documents can't be created if license is not set correctly)3. Search (1)In the document from step 2, type some text, for example ' 25 aliquots of serum were frozen in liquid nitrogen'. Save and close the document. In Workspace search bar, search for 'serum' or 'frozen'; this tests that database indexing is working correctly.4. Search (2)Upload a PDF, plain text or Office file containing some text. Search for a word; the document should appear in search results. This tests that indexing of text-based files is working properly.5. Audit trailIn 'MyRSpace -> Auditing' click 'Get Audit report' which should retrieve a table of recent events. This tests that the audit log is both being written, and is readable How did we do?Related ArticlesSecuritySetting up LDAP-based Single Sign-OnCloud Storage Integrations (Google Drive, Dropbox, Box, OneDrive, Egnyte)(opens in a new tab)Powered by HelpDocs(opens in a new tab)×ContactSend

What is more, you can add a suffix to the name when batch editing, so that your items are neatly named using a number, letter, or date suffix!We've also added the ability to give sample templates a custom word to use instead of "subsamples", to make it clearer what the Inventory entries refer to, and made various other improvements to the system, such as the ability to specify quantities of samples when performing an import. More details below!Overview videoFeaturesBatch editing of items (Edit a Sample or Container)Ability to specify a custom name for “subsamples” in a sample template (Create and Use Sample Templates)Ability to set sample quantity as part of sample import (Import Samples into Inventory)Improved search result refreshing after performing an actionVarious bug and performance improvementsRelease 1.73 - December 2021In this last release of the year, we've added more support for chemistry, by implementing a 2D/3D viewer for chemical file attachments that is available for chemistry files added to the attachments section of an item, or added to an attachment field on a sample. The latter is new: a general "attachments" sample template field that can be used to better organise attachments on samples, whether they're images, PDFs, or chemical files.We've also made a few improvements to our import feature, as well as a few minor usability updates. We're looking forward to seeing you next year, as we have a whole list of exciting features we'll be working on: you can get a preview on our roadmap!FeaturesChemical 2D/3D preview for chemical file attachments (Add a File Attachment to an Inventory Item)Attachment sample template field, with chemical 2D/3D preview support (Create and Use Sample Templates)When importing samples, you can select an existing template to use (Import Samples into Inventory)Temperature and sample source fields have sensible default values when importingDeleted status shown in card viewVarious bug fixes and improvements to our testing workflowRelease 1.72 - November 2021This release introduces a complete redesign of the advanced search: we've made it easier to discover and enable search filters by moving them to sit right below the searchbar, and we now display which filters are enabled for your current search to help you quickly understand what you're viewing. We're very happy with this redesign and hope you'll like it too!We've also continued improving our templating functionality, by adding the ability to remove fields and options, and have also improved some of our interface visuals and communication.

This includes the ability to quickly create templates from scratch, useful previewing of images and chemical files, and improved performance, among other changes. In the coming months, we'll continue working on core features such as templating, chemistry support and exporting!Note that Inventory is now part of our normal release cycle, which includes ELN changes, hence why it is part of release 1.71! We'll continue providing detailed release notes for Inventory features here, and you can find out about the ELN updates on our changelog.Overview videoFeaturesCreate sample templates from scratch (Create and Use Sample Templates)Improved performance for large quantities of contentView preview and card images in full-screenPreview chemical files that are added as file attachments (Add a File Attachment to an Inventory Item)Improved visuals when starting on a fresh inventoryPointers to documentation in the interfaceDefault landing location is now My BenchInformation on who you are logged in as available in the sidebarVarious bug fixesBeta Release - September 8th! 🎉 🎉 🎉The time has finally come! Our next-gen sample and inventory management system is now available to all new and existing RSpace Team and Enterprise customers at no additional cost.Inventory Beta is our first production release of the system, meaning it is ready to be used with your real-life samples. We've overhauled this page to include all the latest information on the release, and how to access Inventory Beta on your system. We hope you enjoy using Inventory, and are excited to hear what you think!Release #8 - September 2021 - Final Pre-Beta Release! 🎉In this release, we focused on ensuring that Inventory has a polished approach to deleting, searching, and restoring items, and added the ability to add file attachments, the final missing pieces for a usable inventory system. As this is the last release before Inventory moves into Beta and is deployed in production, we've reviewed and improved the performance of the system for a slick experience, as well as made a variety of usability improvements, such as making the owner of an item easily accessible, improving interactions with context actions, and overhauling the grouping of item fields for a more intuitive experience!There's no video overview for this release, as we direct our focus on preparing for the Beta release! As always, here is a full list of changes:FeaturesImproved deletion flow (Edit a Sample or Container):Ability to restore items from trashAdded filters for searching items in trashAbility to add file attachments to Inventory items (Add a File Attachment to an Inventory Item)Updated icons to more intuitively represent various item typesAdded more sample template examples, including example identifier fieldsAdded owner (and parent sample for subsamples) information in the header of all itemsAdded badge to select action, to indicate number of selected itemsAdded explanation to disabled context actionsAdded informational toasts showing when actions are being processedMade item field groupings more consistentImproved subsample notes with better UI and HTML renderingEnabled finding items by Global ID in searchVarious performance improvements & bug fixes to make system robust for releaseAbility to toggle availability of Inventory through the inventory.available System Administration property, off by default for this initial release (Introduction to configuring RSpace Apps)Release #7 - August 2021This release introduces Benches for all users! Benches are a place for storing newly created subsamples and containers, imported subsamples, or anything else that you decide to move into it; for example, you might want to move an item to your Bench if have checked it out from a freezer and are currently working with it, so your colleagues know that this item can be found with you.We have also made improvements to list view display: you can toggle what data is shown in the second column, if you wish to quickly scan what the value is for your list of items. Also, you can now sort entries by various properties as well, in all view modes!4 minute overview videoFeaturesBenches for you and your colleagues, for storing newly created or imported items, as well as items you are currently working on (Use Benches in Inventory)Easily move all the items in a List of Materials to your Bench (Using Inventory Lists of Materials in the ELN)Customisable list view column, so you can quickly overview and identify item properties (Search Inventory)Sort entries by name, type, global ID, creation or modification date (Search Inventory)Updated move dialog that now allows for search, advanced search, view toggling, sorting and easily navigating between benches and containers (Move Samples and Containers)Left-hand panel breadcrumbs only appear on mobile view to improve navigation; they are disabled in desktop view as right-hand breadcrumb trail can be used (Navigate Inventory)Adjusted pagination options to 5/10/25/100 (or "all" if less than 100) items (Search Inventory)Release #6 - June 2021This release introduces our ELN - Inventory Integration!

You can learn more the newest features and roadmap for this module at the RSpace Inventory Hub.Users can use RSINV to manage and track ANY large set of real or conceptual items located in simple or complex nested containers, storage areas or locations of any kind. Items can be assembled into cohorts and attached to experiments as Lists of Materials (LoM) that show which samples have been used within your ELN, or from the Inventory side, users can quickly determine which experiments a sample has been used in. Efficient mechanisms for bulk import and export and a powerful "API first" design facillitiate exchange of sample information to or from other systems.The design draws on principals of visual cognition to make maximum use of the human ability to instantly recognize objects and locations based on their appearance and spacial relationships. The result is an intuitive, flexible system that will help to promote efficiency, save time and reduce errors.First steps & initial setupThe following video steps you through the initial setup of Inventory. A written version of the steps is provided below.Before you start setting up Inventory:Ensure you can access the system through the Inventory tab:Decide who is responsible for setting up and keeping Inventory organised: this could be the PI, lab admin, RSpace system admin, inventory manager, or an RSpace power user.Watch the full overview video (also available below). You can also browse the Inventory documentation.You can schedule Inventory training for your lab by contacting us.Create your top-level, lab-owned containers such as rooms, major storage areas, freezers and shelving units (see Create a Container). It is recommended that you set these top-level containers to only contain containers.Individuals can then create their own containers inside those top-level containers (see Move Samples and Containers). You can use photographs of your actual containers for visual containers or preview images to help users recognise them (see Edit Locations in Visual Containers).Work with your colleagues to design and create the lab's most important sample templates (see Create and Use Sample Templates). Encourage your colleagues to make their own personal sample templates too.If you have legacy sample data from other systems, convert that data to CSV and import the samples (see Import Samples into Inventory).Use the system and encourage your colleagues to use it too. Cooperation & collaboration between individuals is crucial to the creation of consistent conventions, best practises, and definitions of samples and subsamples that will make your lab more efficient and organised.Give us feedback on your experience, especially with respect to the roadmap. We need your help to prioritize new features added in future releases.Full overview videoThe following video overviews the main features of Inventory:All Inventory videos and release updates can also be found on our YouTube playlist.DocumentationAll Inventory help articles can be found in the Inventory category, or through the in-app support panel.The following articles are a good place to get started with using Inventory:Create a ContainerCreate a SampleCreate and Use Sample TemplatesEdit a Sample or ContainerNavigate InventorySearch InventoryMove Samples and ContainersImport Samples into InventoryUse Benches in InventoryUsing Inventory Lists of Materials in the ELNExporting inventory data in .CSV formatHow did we do?Related ArticlesNavigate Inventory 🧪Search Inventory 🧪Inventory API Introduction 🧪(opens in a new tab)Powered by HelpDocs(opens in a new tab)×ContactSend

Anyone can use these templates either directly, or by copying them and adjusting the copy to their needs. A copy taken from a default template follows standard permission rules, i.e. is only visible to owner and members of their group.Manage default Sample TemplatesTo change default sample templates you need to log in to RSpace as an owner of default templates, that's usually System Admin (sysadmin1) user. If it's not sysadmin1, check the owner field in the details panel of one of default templates.Any template owned by default template owner is treated as a default template, i.e. is visible by every RSpace user. After logging in as an owner of default templates you'll be able to edit the templates the usual way. Any new template you create will be visible to every RSpace user, and any template that you delete will stop being displayed in standard template listings.How did we do?Related ArticlesCreate and Use Sample Templates 🧪Create a Sample 🧪Edit a Sample or Container 🧪(opens in a new tab)Powered by HelpDocs(opens in a new tab)×ContactSend

This article explains how to prepare your existing sample/subsample/container data as CSV, and how to perform an import in Inventory.The import process is as follows:Export your existing data as CSV, and ensure it fits the CSV format requirementsCurrently your samples, subsamples and containers need to be listed in separate CSV files but you can define the relationship between items within the imported CSV files and upload up to three CSV files at a time in a single import event to therby import multiple samples (each made up of different subsamples) and with your subsamples placed into specified list containers.If you import a list of samples using a single CSV and you don't include a subsample CSV, then your imported samples always contain a single subsample by default.Subsamples can be only imported together with samples, so when preparing a subsamples CSV file also prepare a connected samples CSV fileWhen importing samples you need to decide which sample template imported samples will be connected to. This could be either a pre-existing sample template, or a new template which is auto-generated during import process. Using a pre-existing template gives more flexibility in deciding the field definitions and default values, but you'll need to ensure that the CSV file matches the template definition exactly. An auto-generated sample template will match the content of a CSV file automatically.After you've prepared your CSV files, go to Inventory -> Import page. This page has containers/samples/subsample tabs that allow you to import multiple files at once (which is useful if you want to set up a hierarchy of containers and import subsamples into these containers in one operation). Alternatively, you can import samples/containers separately, and connect them later (e.g. by moving imported subsamples into separately imported containers with standard 'move' operation). The only requirement is that subsamples import requires defining samples as a part of the same operation, that's because subsamples can't exist on their own, they need to be tied to samples.On Inventory -> Import page you should upload CSV files. Samples import page let you decide whether to use an already existing, or auto-generated template for samples, and specify which columns you want to import and what data type each column should have. Containers and subsamples import pages allows you to convert CSV columns into default container or subsample fields.Here's an overview of importing samples into a new auto-generated template:1. Export your sample, subsample and container data into CSV filesCSV is a common format for table-type data; any spreadsheet software should be able to export data as CSV.CSV format requirementsFirst row has to be a row containing column names. No columns in the header row can be blankAll rows must have the same number of columnsAll columns must contain non-blank valuesBlank rows are ignoredBlank values are fineMaximum number of rows is: 500 per containers CSV file, 1000 per samples CSV and 2000 per subsamples CSVYou can check our example files: example_samples.csv and example_containers.csv. Open the files in your spreadsheet software to see how the data looks, as well as try importing it to get a feel for the process. We don't recommend using MS excel for working with these CSV files because excel may automatically force some data to be reformatted, especially dates.Export as CSV in Google SheetsIn Google Sheets, you can do this by going into File -> Download -> Comma-separated values (.csv)Export as CSV in ExcelIn Excel, you can do this by going into Export -> Change File Type -> CSV (Comma delimited)You may have a better experience working with .csv data using applications that do not automatically apply formatting (e.g., LibreOffice ). MS Excel is known to automatically introduce a range of formatting changes into .csv files than can negatively affect the RSpace import process.2. Import your Containers into RSpace InventoryNote that you can only create LIST containers using this import method. This is because of the difficulty of specifying the exact location of every subsample if you use grid or image containers. If you need to use grid or image containers, consider importing your subsamples to your bench first, then manually moving them to appropriate containers.We will be using example_containers.csv for this example import. If the file downloads as example_containers.csv.xls, please rename it to example.csv before importing.Click on Import -> Containers in the inventory sidebar (or switch to Containers tab if already on Import page)Click on Select Containers CSV File to upload your CSVThe table displays all the columns that were found in your CSV, and enables you to choose which container fields should be populated with data from given column. You can use the checkboxes to select which columns you wish to import.To perform an import, you must set one column to convert to the Name of the container. The conversion to 'Name' will be automatically selected if there is a CSV column called 'Name', otherwise the dropdown menu let you select the required conversion option.Inventory suggests different conversions based on the data and names of the columns. The data format rules used for suggestions and available field types for a column are described in the table further down this page.You can define the hierarchy of containers by adding 'Import Id' and 'Parent Container Import Id' columns to the CSV file. To say that "container A" should be created inside "container B" add the unique value (e.g. 'contA') in an 'Import Id' column of the CSV row defining "container A", then reference this value in 'Parent Container Import Id' column of the CSV row defining "container B".Items can also be imported into an existing container. In order to do that, enter a valid container Global Id in a CSV file column, then map it to the 'Parent Container Global Id' field.Please note that you should not map both Parent Container Ids at the same time: an error alert will be displayed in that case.Once you are done assigning the conversion options, click on the Import button.You will get a success message if your import has succeeded. Clicking on the dropdown arrow will show you the list of uploaded containers, with clickable global IDs. The imported items are placed in a "virtual" container on your Bench. If your import is unsuccessful, the error message will explain the problem. In such case you may want to check the troubleshooting guide below.3. Import your Samples into RSpace Inventory(optional) Prepare a Sample Template to be used for imported samplesThis step is optional, you can skip it and import samples into auto-generated template instead.Auto-generated template is a quick way to get your samples into the Inventory, but creating a custom template upfront gives you some benefits:full control on field types, default values, and possible options on radio/choice fieldsway to define some additional properties on template level, e.g. Quantity Unitway to import from multiple CSV files and still have samples that all link to a single sample template. If you have multiple CSV files, and keep using an auto-generated template for each file, the samples imported from different files will have no connection to each other.The downside is that you must ensure that the pre-made template you select must precisely match the data fields of the samples you are trying to import from CSV file. If you use an auto-generated sample template, it should match the content of your CSV file automatically.See our documentation on how to Create and Use Sample Templates 🧪. The sample template used for import must follow a few rules so the incoming CSV file is considered valid:the number of template fields must be the same as the number of columns in CSV file (not counting the CSV columns that will be put into core sample fields, e.g. name, expiry date, etc.).the template fields must be named and ordered the same as columns in CSV filethe template fields must have types and definitions matching incoming CSV linesWe will be using example-sample.csv for this example import. If the example file downloads as example-samples.csv.xls, please rename it to example_samples.csv before importing.(optional) Prepare subsamples CSV with details of subsamples that should be created for imported samplesYou can import a single samples CSV on its own, in that case each imported sample will have a single default subsample. But if you want to specify more details of subsamples (e.g. Quantity) that should be created for each imported sample you can do that too, by uploading a subsamples CSV that references the samples defined in samples CSV. Check the section on subsample import below.Import the Samples CSVClick on Import -> Samples in the inventory sidebar (or switch to Samples tab if already on Import page)Click on Select Samples CSV File to upload your CSVIf you want to use auto-generated template, keep Create new template option selected, and set the template name for the new template.If you want to import samples using pre-existing template, select it on Choose existing template listing.All the samples imported in the same CSV will share a sample template; if you wish to assign different templates to some samples, you will have to create separate CSVs for each sample type and import them separately.The table displays all the columns that were found in your CSV, and enables you to choose what Inventory field type each will be converted to during import. You can use the checkboxes to select which columns you wish to import.To perform an import, you must set one column to convert to the Name of the sample. To change the field type of a column, click on the dropdown and select a type:Inventory suggests different field types based on the data in the columns, which you can change. The data format rules used for suggestions and available field types for a column are described in the table further down this page.If you select Custom field, the view will expand so you can rename the column, and select from the field types available.Clicking on the custom field type will give you a dropdown of field types that are available for that column. See the table further down this article for information on the rules used to determine which field types are available for a column.You can use the arrow on the right to expand or close the custom field options view.Once you are done assigning field types, click on the Import button.You will get a success message if your import has succeeded. Clicking on the dropdown arrow will show you the list of uploaded samples, with clickable global IDs. The imported items are placed in a container on your Bench. If your import is unsuccessful, the error message will explain the problem. In such case you may want to check the troubleshooting guide below.4. Import your Subsamples into RSpace InventoryWe will be using example-subsamples.csv for this example import. If the file downloads as example-subsamples.csv.xls, please rename it to example.csv before importing.Subsamples can be imported by themselves and associated with an existing Sample OR if you are importing entirely new Samples AND Subsamples, then Subsample import can be executed together with Samples import in a single import event using 2 CSV files. We will use example-sample.csv for samples import part. Each subsample needs to reference a sample from samples CSV that is a part of the same import.Click on Import -> Subsamples in the Inventory sidebar (or switch to Subsamples tab if already on Import page)Click on Select Subsamples CSV File to upload your CSVThe table displays all the columns that were found in your CSV, and enables you to choose which container fields should be populated with data from given column. You can use the checkboxes to select which columns you wish to import.To perform an import, you must set one column to convert to the Name of the subsample. The conversion to 'Name' will be automatically selected if there is a CSV column called 'Name', otherwise the dropdown menu let you select the required conversion option.Inventory suggests different conversions based on the data and names of the columns. The data format rules used for suggestions and available field types for a column are described in the table further down this page.To perform an import of subsamples, you must set one column to convert to the Parent Sample Import Id (or, alternatively, an existing Parent Sample Global Id - see below), and also import a corresponding samples CSV file that converts one of the columns to 'Import Id'. This way subsamples can be tied to the correct samples. To say that "SubSampleA" should be associated with parent sample "SampleAB" add the unique value (e.g. 'sAB' in an 'Import Id' column of the sample CSV row defining "sample AB", then reference this 'sAB' value in 'Parent Sample Import Id' column of the subsample CSV row defining "subsample A.01".Subsamples can be imported into an existing sample. In order to do that, enter a valid sample Global Id in the Subsamples CSV file column, then map it to the "Parent Sample Global Id" field. Please note that you should not map both Parent Sample Ids at the same time.Samples and / or subsamples can also be imported already enclosed in a new container by using a separate CSV file and a Parent Container Id, or they can be added to existing containers already in RSpace. To do that, enter a valid container Global Id in the Parent Container Global ID CSV file column, then map it to the "Parent Container Global Id" field. Note that currently only simple LIST containers are supported by the import mechanism.In the example below, subsamples are being associated with samples in a separate sample CSV file using a Parent sample import Id but are being placed into a specific existing container based on the container's RSpace global ID, which was included in the "Parent Container Global Id" column of the subsample CSV.If you have mapped the 'Parent Sample Import Id', then switch to the Samples tab, and import a samples CSV file that defines the samples referenced by imported subsamples.Note: if you have mapped the 'Parent Sample Global Id', there is no need to do that. The subsamples can be imported on their own, provided the referenced 'Parent Sample Global Id's are all valid Ids of existing samples.Quantity information for each imported subsample can also be provided, by adding it to a CSV column that will be mapped to the Quantity field (just like for samples).Once you have uploaded and assigned conversion options for both Samples and Subsamples CSV, click on the Import Samples + Subsamples button.You will get success messages if your import has succeeded. Clicking on the dropdown arrow will show you the list of uploaded samples and subsamples, with clickable global IDs. The imported items are placed in a container on your Bench. If your import is unsuccessful, the error message will explain the problem. In such case you may want to check the troubleshooting guide below.Troubleshooting GuideWhile we have tested import extensively, it is a new feature and thus might contain some bugs. If you're having issues, please email us with your CSV file and we will investigate!Check that your CSV fits the format requirements.Dates MUST be in the ISO format yyyy-mm-dd. If you use MS Excel to edit your CSV file, excel may automatically force reformat of certain values, especially dates and times. If you experience this, consider using a different editor app that does not automatically reformat your CSV files.Expand the warning message for details on why the import failed:Check if any of the fields in your .csv contain commas (eg. 1, 3); these should be enclosed in quotes (eg. "1, 3") to be treated as a single value. This is due to CSVs using commas to separate columns, and the presence of commas in fields causing a conflict.Different applications open, process and save .csv files differently. It's really easy to acquire a .csv file that is in the wrong format. Even if the file LOOKS like a "comma-separated value" file when viewed with a specialized spreadsheet program, the values may in reality be separated by tabs or the values may be delimited in some way that RSpace does not recognize. Even opening and resaving a .csv file that USED to work with RSpace can sometimes cause it to be converted into a format that is incompatible depending on the characteristics of the application you opened it with last. If in doubt, try examining your .csv file not with a spreadsheet application, but with a simple text editor instead. Files you want to import to RSpace should separate values ONLY with commas. In the example below the top file will not import properly to RSpace, the bottom file will.Rules for field type suggestionsInventory suggests different field types for CSV columns based on predefined rules. The first matching rule is used as a field suggestion. You can always change the field type of the CSV columns during import.Column propertiesSuggested field typeTypes you can change the field intoAll values are empty or whitespacePlain textRadio (if < 20 distinct values), Formatted textAny value is longer than 100 charactersFormatted textNoneAll values in a column are dates that are in ISO-8601 format (i.e. 2021-01-29)DateRadio (if < 20 distinct values), Plain text (if < 100 characters), Formatted textAll values in a column are integers or real numbersNumberRadio (if < 20 distinct values), Plain text (if < 100 characters), Formatted textAll values in a column are in the HH:mm time format (i.e. 13:42)TimePlain text (if < 100 characters), Formatted textAll values in a column are URLs (e.g. https://www.researchspace.com/)URIPlain text (if < 100 characters), Formatted textThere are no more than 20 distinct values in the column, and there are repeated valuesRadioChoice, Plain text (if < 100 characters), Formatted textIs not suggested, but can be switched to from a Radio fieldChoiceRadio, Plain text (if < 100 characters), Formatted textDefaultPlain textRadio (if < 20 distinct values), Formatted textRules for mapping into core sample/subsample/container fieldsYou can map CSV file columns into some of core sample fields: Name (required), Description, Expiry Date, Quantity, Source or Tags. Below are the rules for deciding if column can be used for a given core sample field mappings.Core propertyRequired formatNameplain text, non-empty value in every rowDescriptionplain textExpiry Date (only for samples)ISO date format, e.g. '2030-12-22'Quantity (only for samples and subsamples)numeric value followed by the unit type, e.g. '200 mg';Supported unit types are: mass (kg/g/mg/μg/ng/pg), volume (l/ml/μl/nl/pl or ㎥/dm³/cm³/mm³) or dimensionless (no unit). Units used for samples in a single CSV file must all belong to the same category, but may differ between rows (e.g. '5 g' in one row, '20 mg' in another).Source (only for samples)one of 3 options: LAB_CREATED, VENDOR_SUPPLIED, or OTHERTagsplain textFor CSV columns matching the format the mapping options will be enabled in Convert To dropdown.How did we do?Related ArticlesMove Samples and Containers 🧪Export Inventory data to CSV or ZIP 🧪Toggle Inventory and Container Views 🧪(opens in a new tab)Powered by HelpDocs(opens in a new tab)×ContactSend

When working on desktop computer, it is sometimes useful to focus on specific information by adusting the number of visible panels from three to two. This makes more space available for the second panel. To do this, click the panel adjuster arrow.This will initially change the view to show ONLY the sidebar and the navigation panel in "wide" mode which will allow the user to see THREE adustable data columns instead of the usual single column. To adjust data shown in the three columns, click any of the three gear icons and choose which attribute the user wants to see in that column. To return back to the three panel mode, click the panel adjuster arrow on the right.If the user wants to switch which the panel (navigation or details) that is displayed in "wide" mode, click on the text of an item in the "Name" column to toggle to the details panel. This can be useful if the details panel includes large images or grids that you want to see more clearly than you might in standard 3 panel mode.To return to showing the navigation panel, click the panel adjuster arrow at the top left of the details panel. Click the panel adjuster arrow again to return to standard three panel view.Navigation BreadcrumbsBreadcrumb links are included when viewing containers or subsamples, to make the hierarchical location of an item visible at a glance, and to enable you to quickly navigate up container hierarchies. In the screenshot below, we can see that Antibody.02 can be found in the tube rack that is inside a big box. We also have a link to the sample the aliquot belongs to. Clicking on one of these links will open that specific container or sample.Samples do not have breadcrumb links, as their subsamples might be located in different containers.Breadcrumbs are also available in the main left-side navigation when in mobile view, and in desktop view only when using the "Navigate to" button: click on a breadcrumb to move up in the hierarchy.Info PanelInfo icons are available throughout the interface. Hovering over the info icon (click and hold on mobile) enables you to quickly view information about a particular item, and you can click on Open to directly view that item.If you own the item, the icon will default to an information icon. If the item is not owned by you, the info icon will display as a people icon to indicate that this is an item shared with you.Mobile viewRSpace Inventory can be used on both desktop and mobile. While the documentation uses the desktop view for examples, the functionality is the same on desktop and mobile, and unless otherwise noted, the instructions for mobile are identical to desktop, with "clicking" being equivalent to "tapping".The desktop's left-panel is the main view in mobile.

A sample is essentially a TYPE of item or a description of the common characteristics of some related family of subsamples. A sample is always made up of one or more similar or identical subsamples. The SUBSAMPLE is the physical item itself. Subsamples can have a physical location, usually within some sort of container, but samples are a conceptual category and do NOT have physical locations, since each sample might be made up of multiple subsamples, and each subsample could have a different location. Metadata can be applied to a whole family of items using the sample page, but each subsample can also have it's own more specific metadata that applies only to that single item.When working with samples, you might want to add custom fields to help users include relevant information and improve reproducibility and consistency by making sure that all samples of a specific type use the same custom fields. This is where using sample templates comes in handy.Sample templates can be created from scratch, created from existing samples, or created using a properly formated .csv file. By creating a template and editing it to your liking, you are able to reuse the structure of a specific sample for future samples. This enables you to create samples with a consistent format, as well as ensuring that fields that are required for safety or regulatory purposes are included for each sample of that type.After editing the template, existing samples based on this template can be updated to latest template version, which will propagate changes to the structure of a sample (e.g. add new template fields), but won't modify any data already saved in the existing samples.Each RSpace deployment has a number of default templates, visible to everyone. You can make a copy of these templates, which makes you an owner of the copy, and allows further editing to your needs.Templates created by a system administrator are visible to everyone on the server; user-created templates are only visible to LabGroups they belong to.Video OverviewThe following video goes over the template features described in this article:Create a brand-new templateClick on 'Create -> Template' on the left-hand navigation bar:You now see the template editor appear. You can set the units of measurement, subsample name and default values, as well as add new fields (see the section 'Editing Templates' below for details).Create a Template from a SampleWhen viewing a sample, click on Create from the context menu.The create dialog will open. Click the Create button at the bottom of the dialog.You can now give your template a name. The template will contain all of the fields of the sample. You can use the checkboxes to select which template fields should have default values taken from the sample; unchecked fields will be left blank on the new template. Once created, the default values for template fields can be edited at any time.Click on Create Template once you are happy.Your template will be created, and you can now use it when creating samples.Create a Sample from a TemplateNow you've created the template, it can be used to create Samples from it.In the sidebar, select Create > Sample.Select the sample template you want from the template list. The arrows at the bottom-right of the table let you browse through templates. You can also search the list of templates for the one you want.The template fields will now be available for you to fill in.A sample can also be created directly from a template, by opening/selecting the template and then clicking the Create button in the context menu. The create dialog (below) will open and you will be able to proceed with sample creation.View a Sample's TemplateWhen viewing a sample, click on the Template's Global ID link under Sample Template.This will open the template the sample is based on.Browse TemplatesClick on Templates in the sidebar to browse a list of all templates that you have access to.Search TemplatesTo restrict a global search to only show templates, click on "Type" filter, and select Templates.Edit a TemplateValues from the template are considered defaults when creating a new sample from that template. As a general rule, template values are only used during creation of a new sample. That means changing value in the template definition will not change already existing samples, e.g. changing description of a template will not update description of already existing samples based on that template. The same rule applies to template fields, e.g. if you update Default Value of a field it will only be used when creating a new sample, and will not be propagated to existing samples.Note that when a template is updated, existing samples that were created from the template are still based on previous version of the template. After new template version is saved you can choose to update a specific sample or all samples to the latest template version, which will propagate structural changes (e.g. add new fields) to existing samples.When viewing a template, click on Edit:You can specify a Subsample Alias, which indicates how you want to refer to subsamples that originate from the sample created using this template. Remember that in RSpace a samples is a set of related or identical subsamples. The subsample is the physical item, the sample is just a description of the item or items. You should also specify what Unit Type and Default Scale the samples should use. If none of the available options are suitable, you can specify your own custom value: in that case, make sure you enter both the singular and plural forms for it.Under Custom Fields, you can change the name and default value for a field, as well as move the field up or down in the list. You can also add a new field, or delete pre-existing one, this is described lower down on this page.For choice or radio fields, you can also add or remove possible values.Once you are done editing, click on Save.Your template will be updated. Note that existing samples that were created from this template will not be automatically updated. You can update the samples by clicking "Yes" on the "Update existing samples?" popup; you can also update all samples or specific samples later, as described lower down on this page.Add a new Field to a TemplateA new template field will be added to existing samples when updating them to latest template version, but the field will not have any value (even if you set default value in the template field). That's to ensure that samples only contain data explicitly set by the sample owner, and to avoid situation where data seems to unexpectedly "appear" in the sample (as a side-effect of changes to template definition).When editing a template, scroll to the bottom of the Fields section and select Add new field.You'll then be able to specify the name of the field, decide whether it is a mandatory field (i.e. all samples created from the template must have a value for this field), its data type, optionally give the field a default value, and move the field up or down the list. Once you are done, click on Save.Note, that adding a new mandatory field will block you from updating existing samples to latest template version. That's because update to latest template never changes data of existing sample, so it won't add any value for mandatory field (even if the template defines default value for that field).If there are existing samples based on your template and you want to add a new mandatory field, first add a field as non-mandatory, then update existing samples to latest template version, set the value for newly added field in existing samples, then update template field again to make it mandatory.Your template will be saved, and any new samples created from this template will have this new field. Note that existing samples that were created from this template will not be automatically updated. You can update the samples by clicking "yes" on the Update existing samples popup; you can also update all samples or specific samples later, as described lower down on this page.Delete an existing Field from a TemplateWhen deleting template field you'll need to decide if field should be deleted from existing samples when these samples are updated to latest template version.When editing a template, scroll to the field you want to delete, and click 'X' button in the right corner of the field area.There are two variants of deletion that decide whether the field should, or should not, be deleted from pre-existing samples based on the template. If 'Remove field from existing samples' variant is selected, the pre-existing samples will have the field deleted when they are updated to latest template version.After selecting a deletion variant you'll see a confirmation that the field is going to be deleted. You can continue editing the template, as the field is not actually deleted until you Save.Once you are done, click on Save. Your template will be saved, and any new samples created from this template will not have the deleted field. Existing samples that were created from this template will not be automatically updated; you can update them by clicking "yes" on the Update existing samples popup; you can also update all samples or specific samples later, as described lower down on this page.View all Samples created from a TemplateWhen viewing a template, scroll down to the bottom to see a list of all samples created from that template. You can also perform a search, or use advanced search to view samples owned by a specific individual.You can also click on Info, then select Show Samples to instantly scroll down to this section.Update a specific Sample to latest Template VersionWhen viewing a sample, the template from which it was defined is linked under the section called "Sample Template". If the sample is based on a template that has since been updated, an "Update" button will be shown. Here, this sample is defied using version 2 of the Antibody template, which can be viewed by tapping the versioned Global ID link, and it can be updated to the latest version with a single tap.Your sample will then be updated to the latest template version, following the rules below with any changes to the template reflected in the sample.Update all of your Samples to latest Template VersionWhen viewing the template, select Info, then Update Samples in the sidebar that appears.Click on Update All if you are happy with how updating the template version will affect your samples.You will get a confirmation that your samples have been updated. You can click on the dropdown arrow in the notification to expand it and obtain direct links to the samples that were updated.Rules for applying template changes to existing SamplesAs a general rule updating a given sample to latest template will not modify any data stored in that sample. Only structural changes (for example, adding or deleting of fields) will be applied, assuming these changes are compatible with data stored in that sample. Updating a sample to latest template will remove an existing field if the person who modified the template explicitly decided that updated samples should loose the fields when deleting the template field. Updating a sample to latest template will add fields if the latest template has new fields, with an empty value being set.In particular, changes to Default Value of template field won't be applied to field value of existing samples. The default values are only used when creating new sample. Data in existing samples can be only updated by editing these samples - individually or with batch edit.Below is an exact set of rules that are applied when updating a Sample (S) to a new version of the Template (T).Check difference between T and S properties:          if T has new subsample alias, update subsample alias of SFor each S field check difference between S field and connected T field:          if the connected T field was deleted with 'Remove field from existing samples' option, delete the S fieldif the connected T field was renamed, rename the S fieldif the connected T field is radio/choice, and the set of possible radio/choice options has changed:          if the option selected in S is valid with new set of possible options from T, update the set of possible options in Sif the option selected in S is not valid with new set of possible options from T, REJECT WHOLE UPDATE ATTEMPT FOR THIS SAMPLEfor each T field, if there is no connected S field (i.e. it's a new field added to T):          if the new T field is not mandatory, add the field to S, with empty value (even if T field has a default value, it won't be used)if the new T field is mandatory, REJECT WHOLE UPDATE ATTEMPT FOR THIS SAMPLEHow did we do?Related ArticlesUse Default Sample Templates 🧪Move Samples and Containers 🧪Create a Sample 🧪(opens in a new tab)Powered by HelpDocs(opens in a new tab)×ContactSend

The List of Materials feature enables tight integration between the ELN and Inventory, enhancing traceability and reproducibility of your work. What is more, Lists of Materials are automatically included when printing ELN documents, and can also be printed out on their own.The purpose of a List Of Materials is two-fold:To link experiments with samples, in order to aid experimental reproducibility and provenance.To easily update quantities of Inventory items while editing an ELN document.Note that:Lists of Materials are linked to document fields, and each field can have multiple lists linked to it.Individuals with view-only permissions to a document will only be able to view the List, not edit it.Add a List of Materials to an ELN document fieldTo add a List of Materials to a document:Open a document in RSpace ELN. Each text field will have a button for adding a List of Materials to it. Each of many fields in a document can have multiple lists, providing flexibility in how best to organise the lists in a document.You can give the list a custom name and description, to help differentiate between various lists.Click on Add items to start populating the list.This will open the Inventory Picker. You can then browse samples, subsamples, and containers, and select items to add to this list. The searching and selection works exactly like in Inventory: see Search Inventory and Select Items in Inventory. Once you are happy with your selection, click Choose. You can always add or remove items later.To view others' Benches, use the benches search option.Your chosen items have been added to the List of Materials table, which includes basic information such as the item's location, Global ID, owner, and the consumed and Inventory quantities. Click on Save to confirm the creation of this List.The Inventory icon updates to indicate how many Lists have been added to a field.To open the List to view or edit it simply click on the Inventory icon, then on the list.Add Items to a List of MaterialsClick on the Inventory icon next to the field the List belongs to, then select the list you want to update.Click on Add items.This will open the Inventory Picker. You can then browse your samples, subsamples, and containers, and select items to add to this list. The searching and selection works exactly like in Inventory: see Search Inventory and Select Items in Inventory. Once you are happy with your selection, click Choose. You can always add or remove items later.The selected items will be added to the list. Click on Save to confirm the changes to this List.You can also quickly create a List of Materials based on the content of a basket that you built earlier in the inventory area. Using baskets is a great way to allow you to quickly recreate identical Lists of materials in multiple similar experiments.Move Items in a List of Materials to your BenchOnce you've assembled a List of Materials, you can automatically move all of the items in the List to your Bench, to indicate that you are currently working with these items.Just click on Move all to my bench:You might get an additional popup, asking if you wish for items that are in containers that are already on your bench to be placed directly onto your bench, or whether the move action should keep these items in their containers.After the action completes, you will see that the location of the items has been updated, both in the List of Materials and Inventory:Remove Items from a List of MaterialsTo remove an item, simply click on the Remove from list cross next to the item in the List, then save the List. Note that this only removes the item from the List, and does not affect the actual item in Inventory.Edit the Consumed and Inventory Quantities of an ItemTo keep track of an item's usage, you can edit the consumed and Inventory quantity of an item from the List of Materials table. This is explained in detail at Edit Quantities in Lists of Materials.Open a List in a New WindowFor easier viewing/editing, you can open the List in a new window, which will make the List expand to the full size of the window.Click on the view in new window icon.You can edit the List as usual from this window.Delete a List of MaterialsTo delete a list, click on the Delete List button on the bottom of the List, then confirm the action. The list and information about used quantities will be deleted, and there is no way to undo this action. Note that the Inventory items will not be affected by this action.Print a Document with Lists of MaterialsTo print a document or save it as PDF, and include the Lists of Materials:Click on the Print icon in the document toolbar.The resulting document will automatically have the Lists appended to the relevant field.Print or Download a List of Materials on its ownTo print a List or save it as PDF:Click on the view in new window icon.This will open the List in a page of its own. Click on the Print icon to open the print dialog.The resulting printout/PDF will only contain the List you've selected.Export a List of Materials as CSVTo export all the data contained in a list, click on the Export button on the bottom-left of the List.If the list has been edited after opening the dialog, clicking on 'Export' will save the changes, then open the Export panel. Choose the export options and confirm the action. The list will be downloaded to your device as a CSV file.Viewing documents associated with an item in InventoryIn addition to associating a set of samples and other Inventory items with a document, a List of Materials also introduces an association between those items and the document that has the list.In Inventory, when viewing a sample, subsample, or container, tapping the "Info" context button opens the sidebar.Tapping "Show Linked Documents" will open a dialog containing a table of all of the documents that contain Lists of Materials that reference this item. If a document has multiple lists that reference the same item many times then the document will only appear in the table once.If you don't have permission to view the document, tapping the button in the "Owner" column will reveal the email address of the document's owner who will be able to share it with you.How did we do?Related ArticlesEdit Quantities in Lists of Materials 🧪RSpace Inventory Hub 🧪Navigate Inventory 🧪(opens in a new tab)Powered by HelpDocs(opens in a new tab)×ContactSend

If you wish to move only one, or a few specific subsamples of a sample, scroll down to the bottom of the sample preview and select the desired subsamples there.When you Create and Use Sample Templates 🧪, you can choose to call your "subsamples" whatever you like using a subsample alias: "portion", "pieces", "aliquots", "sections", "chunks", "bottles", "items", "animals", or anything that you use in your specific research. In the example below the user wants to move three aliquots.You can also search for specific subsamples by name, sort the list, or toggle the view.You'll be shown a tree view of top-level containers by default. Browse the container tree to your desired target container and select it, or use the Bench filter to select a bench to move the item into. You can click to expand/collapse containers that have inner containers. Containers that do not have enough space or are not suitable for this move action will be greyed out. You can also click on "Make top-level" when moving a container to put it among the top-level containers (containers without parents).Note that search, search filters, sorting, and views are also all accessible in the move dialog.For a list container, you can directly click Submit. In the case of a grid or visual container:Select locations by clicking on individual locations, or by click-and-dragging (on desktop). You can deselect with click/click-and-drag as well.You can hover over the info icon to see which items you are placing in which locations. You can also expand the selection panel to see which is the next item to be placed.Once you have selected locations for all the items you are moving, click on Submit.When looking at the Locations and Content section of a grid container, switching to List view and selecting "Grid Coordinates" as an adjustable column option will show the coordinates of each stored item.A sample is essentially a TYPE of item or a description of the common characteristics or metadata associated with some related family of subsamples.  A sample is always made up of one or more similar or identical subsamples. The subsample is the physical item itself, whereas a sample is a conceptual category. Subsamples can have a physical location (usually within some sort of container) but samples do NOT have a physical locations, since each sample might be made up of multiple subsamples, and each subsample could have a different location. However, you can gather a set of scattered subsamples from a variety of physical locations and move all of them to a SINGLE new location by moving the sample. Moving a sample acts like a "batch" move event, useful for moving an entire set of subsamples without having to move each one separately.How did we do?Related ArticlesImport Samples, Subsamples and Containers into Inventory 🧪Edit a Sample or Container 🧪Toggle Inventory and Container Views 🧪(opens in a new tab)Powered by HelpDocs(opens in a new tab)×ContactSend

For example, "Ex*" would display the same results in the above screenshot. A question mark can also be used to match just a single character, e.g. search for "Batch.?" to find both "Batch.A" and "Batch.B"You can save a search by clicking on the bookmark icon, which will save your query and search filters under the Saved dropdown.You can use the dropdown menus below the search bar to filter the search results by type, status, and/or by owner (within your LabGroups), as well as items in others' benches. By default, search results only return Current items on your own bench. The filters applied to the current search can be seen in the grey pills just below the filter dropdown menus.Some search filters, when applied, will have an x symbol which you can click to remove that filter, leaving any remaining filters still applied.You can view and restore items that are in the trash by filtering by either Current & In Trash, or by In Trash only.Search Results OptionsSort orderYou can use Sort By to change the ordering of the items. The options are Name, Type, Global ID, Created, and Last Modified, and clicking on an option again will change whether it is descending or ascending. The default sort order is by Last Modified (descending).ViewsYou can use Change View to change between list, tree and card views, as well as grid and visual views for containers.

Your choice is maintained in that browser tab until a page refresh; the default column is Global ID.On a desktop computer, you can use the panel adjuster to change from seeing three panels to two, allowing more space for the user to see THREE adjustable columns at once. This makes it easier for the user to compare search results by various different attributes simultaneously. The panel adjuster button used to toggl hide / show the right hand details panel is placed just need to the main search box.The available options in the column adjuster (gear icon) depend on what items you are currently viewing. If you have a mix of items, then selecting an option that is specific to a certain kind of item will simply show nothing in that column for the other items (eg. selecting Container Type will show nothing for Samples).For Type, Global ID, Created, and Last Modified, you can click on the column header to change the sorting of the items by ascending or descending.Column options and applicabilityOptionApplicable to?OwnerAllGlobal IDAllLast ModifiedAllCreatedAllQuantitySamples, SubsamplesExpiry DateSamples, TemplatesSubsamples CountSamplesPrevious Location (that is not a Bench)Subsamples, ContainersCurrent LocationSubsamples, ContainersLast MovedSubsamples, ContainersSampleSubsamplesContainer TypeContainersContentsContainersNumber of Empty LocationsContainersGrid CoordinatesGrid Containers, when content is viewed in the right-hand panelVersionTemplatesOwnershipYou can determine whether you own an item based on the info icon: it will display as a people icon if the item is owned by someone else.Access Permission levelsSearch results may look different depending on which permissions you have on them.If you don't have full permissions on an item, you will still see part of its details (e.g. when the item is owned by a member of your group but its access is set to "Only the Owner") or minimal details ie Name and Owner (e.g. when the item is owned by a user in another group).In that case the item would be displayed with one of the following icons in the results list:a "padlock" icon means limited view: you can see the Overview, Details, and Barcodes sections in the right hand panela "no access" icon means minimal (or public) view: only Name and Owner would be visible in the right hand panelGlobal IDClicking on the Global ID will redirect to the stable link associated with the item.

You can store as many items as you want in a list container.Grid containers represent containers with a defined structure, for example, 96 well plates or  -70 freezer boxes, and show the contents in a grid of a specified size.Visual containers allow you to specify locations onto an image you upload.You can also view the contents of all containers as a tree, cards, or list: this is detailed in Toggle Inventory and Container Views. You can also search container contents: see Search Inventory. Note that advanced search is not available in grid/visual views.Creating a containerTo create a container:There are two ways to start the creation of a container:To create a container on the Bench.In the sidebar, click on Create > Container. On mobile, you can open the sidebar using the top-left menu icon.To create a container inside an existing container.When viewing an existing container, click the Create button in the context menuor (for grid and visual containers) click directly in one of the container's empty locations. The create dialog will open: choose an empty location and then click the Create button at the bottom of the dialog.The right panel will display the container creation menu. Fill in the relevant fields, such as adding a name, and any relevant optional fields.Specify the container type, and whether it can store samples and/or containers. You can't change the container type once it's chosen.For a list container, you don't need to specify additional properties.For a grid container, specify the number of columns and rows in the grid. The maximum dimensions are 24x24.You can also click on "Configure grid layout" to edit the row and column labels; by default, rows will be alphabetical and columns will be numerical (see Customise Axis Labels for Grid Containers)For a visual container, add an image and edit it if needed. You will need to use Edit Locations either during or after creation to define the locations of items within this container in order to use it (see Edit Locations in Visual Containers).Scroll down and click Save once you have filled in all relevant details. You can also add file attachments such as safety PDFs to the container.The left panel will refresh so you can view your newly created container. On mobile, click on the left arrow to go back to the list of containers.The container will be placed on your Bench. You might want to move items into the container, or move the container itself: to achieve this, see Move Samples and Containers.You can also link to this container: see Link to a Sample or Container (Global ID).How did we do?Related ArticlesEdit a Sample or Container 🧪Create a Sample 🧪Move Samples and Containers 🧪(opens in a new tab)Powered by HelpDocs(opens in a new tab)×ContactSend

A sample is essentially a TYPE of item or a description of the common characteristics of some related family of subsamples. A sample is always made up of one or more similar or identical subsamples. The SUBSAMPLE is the physical item itself. Subsamples can have a physical location, usually within some sort of container, but samples are a conceptual category and do NOT have physical locations, since each sample might be made up of multiple subsamples, and each subsample could have a different location. However, users CAN select a sample and use the "move" action to consolidate all of the member samples, moving each related subsample from wherever it is now to a single new location. Metadata can be applied to a whole family of items using the sample page, but each subsample can also have it's own more specific metadata that applies only to that single item.To create a sample:In the sidebar, click on Create > Sample. You can open the sidebar on mobile using the top-left menu icon.The right panel will open the sample creation wizard, which you can advance through by scrolling. Give your sample a name and pick a sample template. Optionally: add a preview image, an expiry date, and the source of the sample. You can also create your own sample templates: see Create and Use Sample Templates.You can also add file attachments, barcodes and custom data fields that are not part of the template, by scrolling to the bottom of the page (see Add a Custom Field to a Sample or Container).A sample is always made up of one or more subsamples. Specify the number of subsamples (i.e. aliquots in this case) and the quantity per subsample. The total quantity will be automatically calculated.When you create sample templates, you can choose to call your "subsamples" whatever you like using a subsample alias: "portion", "pieces", "aliquots", "sections", "chunks", "bottles", "items", "animals", or anything that you use in your specific research.Optionally, add a description, a storage temperature, an expiry date, and any tags. When done, click on Save.You will get confirmation that your sample has been created.The navigation panel will refresh so you can view your newly created sample. If you don't see it there, make sure the "Samples" category is selected in the sidebar.On a mobile device, you may need to click on the left arrow to go back to the navigation panel to view your samples.If you did not specify a location for the new sample and it's subsamples, you will find the subsamples (i.e the physical item(s) ) of the newly created sample on your Bench. You might want to move some or all of these subsamples to a suitable container. To achieve this, see Move Samples and Containers.You can also create samples in-situ by navigating to a specific container and using the "Create" button to initiate sample creation from there, automatically adding the new subsamples directly to the selected container:Once you have created samples you could choose to copy the unique identifier link of the sample or subsample to an RSpace ELN document. See Link to a Sample or Container (Global ID).However, a better way to build cohorts of items and show how you have used them in RSpace documents is to create a List Of Materials (LOM) that allows you to locate and specify items you used in your experiments or procedures. This has the advantage that creating a LOM automatically also creates reciprocal links in the info area of your items, showing which inventory items have been used in which RSpace ELN documents.How did we do?Related ArticlesCreate and Use Sample Templates 🧪Edit a Sample or Container 🧪Create a Container 🧪(opens in a new tab)Powered by HelpDocs(opens in a new tab)×ContactSend

By default, an item will be shared with all of the LabGroups that the owner of the item is a member of, but sharing of each item can also be configured to be any combination of Labgroups (including ones the user is not a member of).The default sharing permissions (hereafter called "Owner's Groups"):All Inventory items belonging to LabGroup members are visible to everyone in the LabGroupItems can be edited, moved, and deleted by anyone in the LabGroupYou can transfer your own items to another user, who can be anyone in the system. PIs and LabAdmins can transfer items of other members of their LabGroupAccess within Collaboration Groups is limited to PIs having access to each other's items (more details provided under Collaboration Groups section)On the other hand, items can be set to a sharing mode where only specified LabGroups have access (hereafter called "Explicit Access List"):Only members of LabGroups listed in an item's access list have access to the itemItems can be edited, moved, and deleted by anyone in the specified LabGroupsMembers of LabGroups to which the item owner is a member, but which are not listed in the item's access list, will not have any access to the itemTransfer remains exclusive to the item's ownerAccess within CollaborationGroups remains unchangedTo make the item private, i.e. only visible to the owner and PI of the item, a user can simply remove all LabGroups from the list.More details on sharing and permissions functionality are presented in the the following sections.Detailed PermissionsAnyone can:view/edit/transfer owned inventory itemsview items inside owned containersview a container that stores owned itemsview/copy default templatesview the most basic information (name and owner) of any inventory item after scanning it's barcodeGroup member can:view/edit inventory items to which their group has accessGroup’s PI/Lab Admin can:view/edit/transfer inventory items owned by members of their groupCommunity Admin can:view items owned by members of their communitySystem Admin can:view everyone’s itemsChanging Access to an ItemBy default, every item starts in the Owner's Groups mode which, as mentioned, gives all of the members of all of the groups that the owner is a member of access to the item. These groups are detailed in the item's Access Permissions section.To change the access mode, tap the item's Edit button, which will display further options:Initially, the Explicit Access List mode also shows a list of the owner's groups. However, this listing can be expanded to include other LabGroups (ones that the user is not a member of, for collaborative purposes) and gives the ability to exclude any of the groups that the owner is a member of.In the above screenshot, Lab D has been granted access to this container and Lab C, despite having the owner as a member, is not granted access. If no groups are selected in the access list, then only the owner and their PI will have access.An item can be returned to the Owner's Groups mode at any time.View items owned by a specific userYou can restrict searches to show items owned by a specific individual who is a member of any of your LabGroups by clicking the 'Owner' dropdown in the search menu, and selecting them.Filter by items you ownItems you own will have the default 'info' icon. If the item is not owned by you, the icon will display as a 'people' icon to indicate that this is an item shared with you.You can filter for items which you own by clicking on the 'Owner' dropdown menu and choosing your username listed under 'me'Transfer OwnershipThis action can only be undone by the recipient or their PI, by having them transfer the items back to you.Subsamples cannot be transferred individually; only the whole sample, including all subsamples, can be transferred.Transferring ownership of an item to someone else gives the new owner full control over the item. If the access permission of the item is set to Owner's Groups this will include changing the groups that have access to the item. Only the current owner of an item, or a PI/LabAdmin of the LabGroup can transfer ownership of an item. The recipient of the transfer can be any other RSpace user.Click on Transfer on an itemSelect someone to transfer the item to. You can use the dropdown to choose from the list of people in your LabGroups, or start typing a name or username of anyone in the wider system, then select from the autocomplete options.Click on Transfer to confirm the transfer.You will get a success notification. Note that if by transferring the item you lose access to it, this will trigger a notification about the item not being viewable anymore.Note: if you are transferring items located on your bench, it will be moved to the recipient's bench (and therefore will not be visible on yours any longer). You can search a bench by owner to view those items again, assuming the recipient is a member of one of your LabGroups.Editing Shared Item - Edit LocksAn edit-lock system prevents multiple individuals from accidentally modifying the same item simultaneously. When you start editing an item, others will not be able to edit the item. The edit lock is released once you stop editing, by either saving, cancelling, or timing out.To prevent items from being locked for a long period of time, the edit lock times out after 5 minutes of inactivity. If you're currently editing, you will get a warning after 4 minutes of inactivity that your editing session is about to expire, and you can choose to renew the lock.If you do not renew the lock, the lock will expire and anyone else with access will be able to edit the item.If you lose the lock, you will not be able to save so as to not overwrite any new changes made to the item. However, you will still be able to see the unsaved changes you've made. If you wish to add those changes to the item, you will have to do so manually. We recommend navigating to the item in a new browser tab, clicking on edit again to claim the lock, then copy-pasting any content you wish to keep from one tab to the other.Collaboration GroupsInventory 'Open Lab' permissions rules currently apply to standard LabGroups, not to Collaboration Groups. The access to items between members of Collaboration Groups is currently limited to PI users:PIs involved in collaboration can see and edit inventory items of other PIs involved in collaborationPIs don't gain any new permissions to see items owned by members of the collaboration group (but they're still able to see items belonging to members of their own LabGroup)members of the collaboration group don't gain any new permissions to see items owned by other members of the collaboration group (but they're still able to see items belonging to members of their own LabGroup)This behaviour is likely to change as we expand sharing capabilities.How did we do?Related ArticlesNavigate Inventory 🧪Search Inventory 🧪Use Benches in Inventory 🧪(opens in a new tab)Powered by HelpDocs(opens in a new tab)×ContactSend

Results will also be affected by camera capabilities, barcode size, and light conditions.The largest range of formats can be scanned using an Android device with camera, or the Chrome browser on a Mac computer with a webcam. These will be able to read 1D barcodes, QR codes, Matrix codes and many more. If you are using a different device/browser combination (e.g Safari on an iPhone), you will still be able to scan QR codes, but not other formats.Barcodes and ItemsEach Inventory item can be associated with one or more barcodes, and a barcode can be associated with one or more items (a "many to many" relationship).If you are editing an existing item, you can save a barcode (generated anywhere) and associate it with the item in the Barcodes section.Once a barcode has been scanned, you can use the value encoded in it to search items in RSpace (1-click "scan and search").Scan an existing barcodeYou can add the same barcode to several items using Batch Edit.To scan an existing barcode:First click Edit at the top of the details panel of the itemScroll down to the Barcodes field, and click the "plus" icon to activate your device cameraPosition the item so that the camera can read the barcode. Alternatively, if the camera is struggling to detect the barcode or you've got a barcode scanner, you can enter the data encoded in the barcode manually.When the camera successfully reads the barcode, the content and format of the barcode will be displayed. Click Save to save that barcode. Note that you can associate more than one barcode with an item.You can edit the label for the newly scanned barcode. Click Save at the bottom of the details panel to save all changes and end the editing session.Search items by barcode ("scan and search")Click on Barcode in the search filters:Your browser might ask for permission to use your camera, which you'll need to allow.Position the item so that the camera can read the barcode.The system will indicate when a barcode was successfully read. Click on Search to display all Inventory results that match your barcode.Even if you don't have permission to fully access the searched item, you will still be able to see its name and owner. You will then be able to contact the owner to gain full access in case you need it.Barcode FeaturesQR codes generated by RSpace encode a direct link to an item, eg. https://university.researchspace.com/inventory/subsample/1310785. Both the generated QR code or any type of barcode that you have associated with an item can be read by another RSpace user in order to access those items via "scan and search".Note that you can use this approach to:read barcodes created by any type of barcode printer that you use in your lab (either currently or in the past) and associate those codes with RSpace itemsread and associate existing barcodes printed on the item by the manufacturerIn the example below, three barcodes are associated with an item, the first is a QR code generated by RSpace (which cannot be deleted) and two additional barcodes that were read directly from the item (which can be deleted if necessary). The two extra barcodes were originally 1D linear barcodes but RSpace converts and displays previews of those as QR codes which can then be printed. Currently RSpace cannot display or print 1D "traditional" barcodes that have been associated with an item.Barcode PrintingSelect one or several items using the checkboxes. Then, click on the three dots menu to expand your actions, and select Print Barcode. Note that this will print out the QR codes generated by RSpace for each item, plus some other details.You can also scroll down to the Barcodes section of an item, and use the print icon to print one or all barcodes associated with an item. Note that all barcodes will be converted to QR codes for printing, even barcodes of a different format that were associated with the item.A print options panel will open, where you can customise the size and information on your label. A preview of what an individual label will look like is displayed on the right.Printer Type supports generic printers, and Zebra label printers.Print Layout has two options: Basic prints the QR code and the record Global ID, and Full prints QR code, Global ID, description, type and name of the item, item location, and label creation time. If you have selected a Label Printer, then you will have to make sure the sticker labels used by your printer match the layout you select. Full will require a rectangular label, Basic will work on both square and rectangular ones.Print Size: small (2cm wide) and large (4cm wide) options are available only if you select Standard Printer. If you select Label Printer, the size will be automatically adapted to the sticker size, so you cannot choose between small and large in this case.After you click on Print Selected, your browser's print dialog will open and display all the barcodes that will be printed. If you selected the Standard Printer option, several labels can be printed on one page. If you selected the Label Printer option, then each label will be printed on a different page, in order to have one label per sticker. You can make any final adjustments, such as margins and scaling, before clicking on Print.Using a Zebra printerThe Print Options panel lets you prepare Inventory item barcode data for a Label Printer, and we support Zebra printer models in particular.This feature gives best results in Chrome and Firefox, while it may not work when using Safari. If you see a broken label preview in the Safari Print window, please use a different browser with your Zebra printer.When you select the Label Printer option in the Print Options dialog, each label will be placed on a different page, which is ideal for printing with a device like Zebra. If you want to print pre-cut labels for 20 containers or 100 subsamples, you can easily achieve this.Some Zebra printers ship with a default pack of labels, but usually support several label sizes (check Zebra website for details on your printer).Matching a Layout with a physical labelYou should make sure you are using the right label for the layout you want to print. Zebra labels can be either square or rectangular. The Full layout option should be printed on a rectangular label (e.g. 1.25" x 3.5") in "Portrait" mode, while the Basic layout is ideal for square labels, as shown below.Other combinations may work: the Basic layout can be printed on a rectangular label (leaving some white space), but we don't recommend printing the Full layout on square labels (unless you rescale accordingly in the printer options).Troubleshooting: label sizes shown in print dialog are not correctIn some cases, after replacing the original printer labels with different sized labels, the browser window may still display the old paper size. This is caused by the printer drivers, and not by RSpace Inventory.In the case shown below, we have loaded a cartridge with square labels (1.25" x 1.25") in a ZSB series printer, but the labels are not detected correctly by the browser (on a macOS device), and the previous label size is shown as the only option.If that happens you can access the OS print dialog (there should be a link in the browser print window) and select the desired label size, or add a custom system setting for your new label, which will then be available to all applications on your device.How did we do?Related ArticlesUse Benches in Inventory 🧪Permissions and Sharing in Inventory 🧪Select Items in Inventory 🧪(opens in a new tab)Powered by HelpDocs(opens in a new tab)×ContactSend

RSpace Inventory provides an easy way to generate a CSV report of your samples, subsamples and containers. The generated CSV file can be opened in a spreadsheet application (e.g. LibreOffice or Google Sheets), it can also be used as a base for re-import (see Import Samples, Subsamples and Containers into Inventory 🧪).Note that CSV files generated by RSpace are using comma (,) as a column separator, and double quote (") as a text delimiter. If the app you're using for viewing CSV file asks you about the separator/text delimiter chars, use comma and double quote, otherwise the file will appear misformated.Export modes: 'Full' or 'Compact'When exporting, selecting an export mode lets you decide if the output CSV file should contain only basic data of samples/subsamples, or should it include custom/template fields too.Depending on the selected export mode the file will contain:FULL and COMPACT: all of standard sample/subsample propertiesFULL mode additionally: content of sample fields (i.e. fields defined by the sample template)FULL mode additionally: content of custom fields (i.e. text/number fields that can be added to any inventory item)Export selected samples/subsamplesOn a sample/subsample listing, select the items to export. Choose 'Export' action (may be hidden in the 'More Actions' menu that shows after clicking on ... dropdown).In the opening Dialog, you will be given the choice to include or exclude the samples' subsamples. Include subsamples if you need complete data (this may generate a larger document), exclude if that extra information is more than you need.Exported data will be downloaded to your computer as a CSV file (or ZIP bundle).Export selected containersOn a containers, select the items to export. Choose 'Export' action (may be hidden in the 'More Actions' menu that shows after clicking on ... dropdown).In the opening Dialog, you will be given the choice to include or exclude the containers' content. Include content if you need complete data (this may generate a large document depending on the amount of content), exclude if that extra information is more than you need.Exported data will be downloaded to your computer as a CSV file (or ZIP bundle).Export all your samples, subsamples and containersSelect 'Export Data' button on the left-hand menu. The export will include all samples, subsamples and containers owned by you.The option to include or exclude containers' content will be available in this case too.Exported data will be downloaded to your computer as a CSV file (or ZIP bundle).Export File Type: ZIP Bundle or Single CSVIn release 1.79 we have added an option to export data either as a ZIP bundle or a single CSV. The ZIP bundle will contain one CSV file for each record type, while the single CSV will contain data about all the exported record types.How did we do?Related ArticlesNavigate Inventory 🧪Search Inventory 🧪Inventory API Introduction 🧪(opens in a new tab)Powered by HelpDocs(opens in a new tab)×ContactSend

To start, click the "Edit Quantities" button at the top of the dialog: the table will display the quantity editor (ie some different columns).The List of Materials table displays:Consumed Quantity: the cumulative quantity of the item used in this experimentInventory Quantity: the automatically calculated remaining quantity of the item, based on the quantity recorded in inventory, minus the consumed quantities of this item across all Lists of Materials (as long as "Update Inventory Quantity" is selected when updating consumed quantities). This is also the quantity shown when viewing the item in Inventory.Updating quantities only works for subsamples.Update the Consumed Quantity of one or more ItemsInventory lets you update the Consumed Quantity of one, or more items at the same time. The same increment will be applied to all selected items, ie you can update one or more than one at the same time. Batch editing requires that all selected items share the same unit category (e.g. mass, volume, or unitless).To select an item, click on the left checkbox (in the "Batch Edit" column). An input field will be displayed to enter the "Additional Consumed Quantity".Adjust the additional consumed quantity in the input field. Note that you can change the unit used as well (only within the same category).Decide whether you want the Inventory Quantity to be updated as well (default) via the checkbox on the right. The Inventory Quantity will be calculated based on the new Consumed Quantity, and update the item's quantity in Inventory.However, you cannot fill in a consumed quantity greater than the inventory quantity if "Update Inventory Quantity" is checked. In such case, an error message will be displayed.In the case where there is a mistake in the Inventory Quantity value, and you wish to fill in the correct and larger value for Consumed Quantity, leave "Update Inventory Quantity" unchecked. This will enable you to increase the Consumed Quantity as much as desired, withut restrictions, and you can then manually edit the subsample's Inventory Quantity inside of Inventory later (see below).Your changes will be reflected in the table immediately. Remember to Save your List to confirm these changes (or Cancel to revert all unsaved changes).Update the Inventory Quantity of an ItemIf there is a mistake in the amount of inventory quantity recorded, you can correct this by manually editing the subsample's quantity within Inventory. To do so:Click on the item's Global ID in the List of Materials.This will open the item in Inventory. Click on Edit.Scroll down to Quantity, which displays the inventory quantity, and edit it to reflect the actual remaining quantity. Finally, Save the item.After refreshing the ELN document, you will be able to see the updated Inventory Quantity in the List of Materials. The consumed quantity will not be affected.Example of Editing QuantitiesThis explains a worked example to edit quantities in a List Of Materials.We start off with two subsamples in our List of Materials. Initially, the list displays how much is remaining (100µl for both samples) and that this experiment has used 0µl.We use 5µl and choose to update the remaining inventory quantity, by clicking on the 'Edit Quantities' button, typing in 5 in the input box, and checking "Update Inventory Quantity" (this box is checked by default).Note that multiple items with the same unit category can be selected and batch edited at the same time.Multiple items can be selected and their quantities edited at once (batch editing), but only if their unit categories match, e.g. you cannot batch edit an item quantity in 'mg' (mass) with one in 'ml' (volume). In that case, saving would be disabled and a warning message displayed.Also, different units can be selected for increments but only within the same category (e.g. for a quantity in 'ml' you can pick 'µl' , but not 'mg' or 'µg').Remember to click 'Save' to persist the changes when you are done editing the List Of Materials.Now, we use another 5µl, setting the consumed quantity to 10µl - the cumulative total of what we have used so far. Again, we choose to update the inventory quantity. After clicking 'Save' again, 90µl is shown as remaining in inventory:Now let's imagine a scenario where there is a discrepancy in quantity between the Inventory software and real-life. For example, we are in the middle of an experiment and we have used 100mg of a subsample but the software says only 72mg is remaining, showing a discrepancy of -28mg (a negative value meaning the difference between used and available) and an error message.In this case, we can still go ahead and record what was used (100mg), by choosing not to update the Inventory Quantity. We can resolve the discrepancy later, by editing the subsample's quantity inside of Inventory (see above). To unlink the two and proceed, just uncheck the box on the right.Color coding: note that quantities were displayed in red to indicate an error, but are now green, meaning the update can proceed.Initially 'Save' is disabled, because the 'Update remaining' button is checked, and we are trying to use more than is remaining, but after unchecking 'Update Inventory Quantity' we can apply the change.So the experimental record is accurate when it comes to Consumed Quantity, even if there is a discrepancy in Inventory when it comes to Inventory Quantity.We can then open Inventory and manually edit the sample's remaining quantity to the correct value (0mg).Whenever no changes to a list or to item quantities have been applied, or an operation is not allowed, the 'Save' button is automatically disabled.How did we do?Related ArticlesUsing Inventory Lists of Materials in the ELN 🧪Edit Locations in Visual Containers 🧪Edit a Sample or Container 🧪(opens in a new tab)Powered by HelpDocs(opens in a new tab)×ContactSend

Benches are a place for storing newly created subsamples and containers, imported items, or anything else that you decide to move into it; for example, you might want to move an item to your Bench if you have checked it out from a freezer and are currently working with it, so your colleagues know that this item can be found with you.Here's how Benches work:Everyone is allocated a single Bench. It is not possible to create, delete, or move a Bench.Newly created items, including imported items, are automatically added to the creatorr's Bench.Anyone can move items to/from their Bench.Anyone can view and move items to/from anyone else's Benches, provided they are members of the same LabGroup.More details on Bench features are provided below.View and Search BenchesYou can quickly access Benches through the sidebar links. My Bench opens up your personal Bench and displays the number of items on your Bench. From there, you can browse others' benches by changing the "Bench" search filter.In these views, you can perform all the same actions that you can when viewing items in the Samples or Containers views, including searching, sorting, changing views, duplicating, moving, and more.If you perform a search again by typing in a query and pressing Enter, the search filters will be reset to default; you will need to re-select someone by using the "Bench" search filter.My BenchAny new subsamples or containers you've created will be located on your Bench; this includes ones created by import (there is a special container added to Bench after import). You can move items out of your Bench by moving them into a container (more details below).Others' BenchesYou can access your colleagues' benches by clicking on the Bench Search Filter dropdown to select or type in the individual whose bench you'd like to view. You can perform actions on these items, such as moving them back to a container, as usual.Move Items In and Out of BenchesGeneral moving is documented in Move Samples and Containers. The moving dialog enables moving to a Bench by clicking on the 'Bench' filter and typing / searching the person's name.To move an item into your Bench, choose your own name in the Move dialog. You can also pick to move the items into a specific container that is already in your Bench; if not, the item will simply be moved onto your Bench.To move an item out of your Bench, move it to a new location: either another person's Bench, or a container. You can also move items between different Benches this way.To move a container into the list of containers as a top-level container, select Make top-level.In the screenshot below, the lab has bought a new fridge and created a 'New fridge' container. This will initially be created on the Bench of the individual doing the creating. This user has selected New Fridge, then 'Move' in the item's context menu, and will click on the 'Make Top Level' button to make easily reachable from the main sidebar.View the Previous Location of Items on a BenchIn List view, you can change the second column to show the last non-Bench location of an item (see Search Inventory). This is useful for when you want to check items back into the containers they were previously stored in.You can change the second column using the gear icon on the right to Previous Location:How did we do?Related ArticlesScan, Use and Print Barcodes in Inventory 🧪Select Items in Inventory 🧪Permissions and Sharing in Inventory 🧪(opens in a new tab)Powered by HelpDocs(opens in a new tab)×ContactSend

A collection of items in Inventory is called "Basket". Baskets can contain any number of items and can be used to create custom categories. For example you can place all your plasmids in a single basket to more easily limit your view of the total list of items in the inventory system to just plasmids.In order to create a basket, select one or more items and click "Add to Basket" from the context menu (Templates cannot be added).In the dialog you can either let the system assign a name to the new basket (no longer than 32 characters), or assign a custom name to it. When a new basket is created, the selected items will be added to it.If you want to add items to an existing basket rather than a new one, just select the target from the dropdown menu.Please note that adding items to a basket will not affect their location.Removing items from a BasketTo remove items from a basket, select the one you want from the dropdown menu.Once the contents are viewed, select one or more items and then "Remove from this Basket" in the context menu.Again, removing items from a basket will not affect their location.Renaming or deleting BasketsYou can rename or delete a Basket by clicking the relevant icon on the right of its name in the dropdown menu (the badge shows the number of items currently in the Basket).Duplicate names are not allowed.Deleting a basket will not affect its contents.You can quickly create a List of Materials (LOM) based on the content of a basket that you built earlier. Using baskets to build your LOM is a great way to browse for items much like shopping for items in a store before your experiment begins.

By associating an IGSN ID with a sample, you enable transparency and traceability between research objects. This is achieved by providing a publicly accessible web page that contains the sample metadata, serving as a unique "source of truth" when referencing the sample in research outputs.The IGSN ID metadata also describes relationships between the resource and other related materials, such as projects, institutions, people, and research outputs; it can also be used to identify an individual sample, a group of samples, or to a feature-of-interest (a collection site for samples). To learn more, see About IGSN IDs for Material Samples.DataCite IntegrationResearch Space is now a DataCite Registered Service Provider, and the first to provide IGSN ID creation and registration services! DataCite provides a IGSN ID registration service through their DOI infrastructure, and a global PID Graph search interface through DataCite Commons. By integrating seamlessly with the DataCite API, we provide support for IGSN IDs and enable institutions to create, publish and update the IGSN ID metadata all without leaving RSpace Inventory.By connecting to an existing institutional DataCite repository through the DataCite API, we ensure that the institution retains full ownership and control over their repositories: the repository is always managed by the institution, with RSpace Inventory only accessing the repository to perform IGSN-related actions.Try it outIf you are a Team or Enterprise customer, you can use the integration after becoming a DataCite member and configuring the integration. See Configure DataCite IGSN IDs in Inventory (for System Administrators).You can request credentials for test servers from DataCite, if you wish to try the integration out on your own RSpace server first. Alternatively, you can use the shared Inventory Test Server to preview the functionality provided.FeaturesOverviewThe DataCite documentation provides extensive information on the functionality, metadata format, and use cases of IGSN IDs. We recommend reviewing DataCite's Getting Started with IGSN IDs guide to start.The following describes how we've implemented the integration.IGSN identifiers can be in one of three states, which correspond to DataCite DOI states:Draft: a newly created IGSN ID without any public metadataAn Inventory item will start without any PIDs.When a user reserves an IGSN ID for an item, DataCite provides a IGSN ID for the item in Draft state, but no metadata about the item is sent from RSpace to DataCite.Reserving an IGSN ID enables the metadata entry section, where users can fill in IGSN ID metadata fields they intend to make public.A Draft IGSN ID can be deleted, as it's not yet part of the global handle system.Findable: a published, searchable IGSN ID with a public landing pageAfter all mandatory IGSN ID fields have been completed, the user can publish the IGSN ID to make the metadata publicly accessible and searchable.RSpace generates a persistent landing page for the sample that includes all IGSN ID metadata for the item, and sends the metadata and landing page URL to DataCite.DataCite registers the IGSN ID with the global handle system, indexes the IGSN ID in DataCite Commons and the DataCite APIs, and sets the IGSN ID to resolve to the RSpace landing page.This IGSN ID is the unique and persistent identifier for this item, and can be used in citations to reliably reference the item.Registered: an IGSN ID that has been retracted from public accessAn IGSN ID that is Findable can be set to Registered to hide the item and its associated metadata from public access, in case the wrong item was published.Note that the Members API can still be used to access this item, so please take care before publishing that all the information is to be made public.Available featuresWe focus on providing support for the core DataCite IGSN ID lifecycle:Create Draft IGSN IDPopulate mandatory metadataPopulate recommended fields:SubjectDescriptionDateAlternate IdentifierGeolocationPublish & generate persistent landing pageMake metadata updates and publish againRetract a published IGSN IDDelete an IGSN ID draftPreview landing pageCreate an IGSN IDRSpace can reserve an IGSN ID in Draft state to be associated with an individual RSpace Inventory item. IGSN ID metadata will be available to fill out in RSpace, but the metadata and identifier are not made public at this stage.The Draft IGSN ID can be deleted, or published to explicitly make the metadata publicly accessible.To create an IGSN ID:Open the Identifiers section on a sample, subsample, or containerPress the + icon to create an IGSN ID. Each Inventory item can only be assigned 1 IGSN ID. Note that if you are in the process of creating a new item, you will need to save the item first before being able to create an IGSN ID for it.If you get a "The Identifier could not be created. IGSN integration is not enabled on this RSpace instance." error, please contact your System Administrator.The identifier section now shows the Draft IGSN ID and its metadata fields. Required fields have been prepopulated with default values.RSpace does not send metadata to DataCite when an IGSN ID is in Draft state, the metadata is only made public when publishing the IGSN ID.Edit IGSN ID metadataClick on Edit when viewing an itemScroll to the Identifiers section, and make the required edits, or add recommended fields.Save to confirm the changes.Saving a sample does not send the updated IGSN ID in DataCite or on the landing page, it enables you to save any in-progress changes to the metadata without making them public. To make the changes public, you need to explicitly Publish the IGSN.Publish an IGSN IDPublishing sets the IGSN ID state to Findable on DataCite. The IGSN ID and its metadata, alongside a landing page generated by RSpace, will be made publicly accessible through DataCite Commons and DataCite APIs. A persistent, citable IGSN ID URL will be created, pointing to the landing page.After publishing, the IGSN ID cannot be returned to a Draft state. Changing the state to Registered keeps the metadata visible to other DataCite Members via the Member API.See DataCite DOI States for more information.Before publishing, please ensure the IGSN ID metadata provided does not contain any information you do not want to make public, as this action cannot be fully undone.To publish an IGSN ID:Click on Publish in the Identifiers section. The button is only enabled if all required fields are filled in.The state of the IGSN ID changes to Findable. A persistent and public landing page is generated and hosted by RSpace. The IGSN ID redirects to this landing page, providing a stable URL that can be used to share and reference this item.A direct link to the RSpace landing page is also provided for convenience, but the IGSN ID should be used in public references to the item.Update an IGSN IDAny IGSN ID metadata changes you make in RSpace are not made public until you explicitly publish them. We recommend only updating an IGSN to provide additional metadata, or to correct any errors.If the item has been modified significantly enough to exhibit different properties, you need to decide whether it is important for you that an IGSN ID always points to a specific version of the item. If so, we recommend creating a separate item in RSpace, assigning it a new IGSN ID, and clearly indicating the link between the historical and new item in their metadata.To update an IGSN ID:Make required changes to the IGSN ID metadata fieldsClick on RetractClick on PublishThe landing page will now reflect the latest version of the metadata.Delete an IGSN IDDeleting removes the IGSN ID and its association with this item.Only Draft IGSN IDs can be deleted. For hiding Findable IGSN IDs from public access, see the Retract an IGSN ID section below.To delete an IGSN ID:Click on Delete in the Identifiers section.The IGSN ID is deleted and removed from the section.A new Draft IGSN ID can be created and associated with the item in the future, whether the item had a Draft IGSN ID previously or not. However, only one IGSN ID can be associated with an item at any one time.Deleting an IGSN ID also removes all metadata you might have filled in, therefore we recommend only deleting an IGSN ID if you are confident this item will not require one for the time being.Retract an IGSN IDClick on Retract to change a Findable IGSN ID into a Registered IGSN ID. This will remove the IGSN ID from DataCite Commons and the DataCite Public API, as well as display no metadata on the landing page. Keep in mind the Member API can still be used to access historical metadata about the item.If you wish to have the sample be public again, you can publish it to turn it back to Findable.How did we do?Related ArticlesConfigure DataCite IGSN IDs in Inventory (for System Administrators) 🧪Select Items in Inventory 🧪Add a File Attachment to an Inventory Item 🧪(opens in a new tab)Powered by HelpDocs(opens in a new tab)×ContactSend

Each RSpace user is assigned there own Bench, which can be thought of as a special type of top-level container into which items can be placed. New items (i.e., containers or samples) are typically created on the creating user's Bench by default. From there, newly created items may be moved to other locations as appropriate. Items that are in use can be moved to a specific user's bench to indicate that the item is not currently in its usual location and is in use by the Bench owner.Container - A physical or conceptual entity used to show where resources are located or how they are organized. There are three types of Container - List, Grid and Visual. Containers can hold subsamples nested hierarchies of other containers or both.List container - Good for containers that contain many items and users are not concerned with the relative location of items withing the container.Grid container - Good for containers that include a square grid of locations where samples can be placed with the relative location of each item specified by the user and displayed by the systemVisual container - Think of visual containers as being like a map. They can be used to manually specify the exact location of items using "hotspots" superimposed on a user specified image. Image containers are flexible and can be used to show things like the location of a room on a floor plan of a building, the location of a sensor on a map of a field site, or a specific jar on photograph of a shelving rack.Details Panel - Also called the right-hand panel, details area or details card. Used to show information about a selected item. Located on the right when viewed on a workstation display. Displays the details of the current item or item selected in the Navigation panel. Their are 4 types of details panel, each panel type has a color coded header for faster recognition:Container details panelSample details panelSubsample details panelSample template details panelAll four types of details panels are customizable, but the Sample details panel is special because it can record more specialized metadata types, with field characteristics defined by a Sample Template for improved consistency.Duplicate - Duplicates and item and adds the word "Copy" to the name. A duplicated sample or subsample has the same volume as the parent. Compare with Split which is used only for subsamples.Import - In RSINV there is a special import mechanism that uses properly formated .CSV files to ingest lists of containers, samples and subsamples and reproduce their hierarchical organization such that large cohorts of complex, legacy inventory data do not need to be manually entered.Import event - A single import event involves the ingestion of one or more .CSV files. Crucially, the import allows for up to three .CSV files to be ingested at once, with the three .CSV files holding data about repectively Containers, Samples and Subsamples, as well as defining the relationships between those entities within the .CSV files themselves. The .CSV used to import Samples during an import event can also be used to create a new Sample Template, defining the structure of the template, which can then be used subsequently to create similar additonal samples in the standard RSINV interface. Lucene - A search technology developed by the Apache foundation. Lucene queries can be used to search for specific items in RSINV by logically combining search terms including things like item names and tags. Learn more about Lucene searches here.Navigational Panel - Also sometimes called the center panel is used to browse through or search for the containers and samples you have access to. This panel allows you to choose between three diffent types of views:List View - Equivalent to the list view in the ELN. Allows users to click or tab on a select box and then perform actions on the selected items.Tree View - Equivalent to the tree view in the ELN. Allows users to browse and explore hierarchically within their containers and samples and provides good organizational awareness of where items are located in a lab relative to each other.Card View - features large image previews to make it easier for users to instantly recognize items and containers based on their real-world appearance.Sample - In RSINV a sample is a conceptual entity refers to the description of a subsample or set of subsamples with a common set of characteristics displayed in the sample details panel. The RSINV subsample is the physical manifiestation of the sample description. In many cases a sample may be made up of the sample plus a single subsample such that the sample details panel can be thought of as merely the information associated with the sample, and the single subsample is the representation of the lone physical sample itself. Samples do not have a location, but the subsamples that comprise a sample do. Samples can also be used a way to bundle together any number of subsamples and move them en-masse to a new location, but if the container type is Grid or Visual, then the location of each individual subsample will need to be indicated in the destination container.Sample Template - Often shortened to just "Template". These can be built using Create > Template, or they can be generated based on structured data imported to RSINV in .CSV format using the Import feature. Sample templates can be used to enforce conventions about metadata collected and associated with samples, and can also be used to give consistant structure to sample data imported from legacy external sources.Sidebar - Also sometimes called left-hand control panel is used to select specific categories of items and perfom important actions such as creating new items.Split - used to split subsamples into any number of new subsamples with each new subsample having a fraaction of the volume of the original subsample. Compare to Duplicate.Subsample - One or more similar subsamples comprise a sample. Subsamples can be given a custom Subsample Alias that defines the language used to refer to subsamples. Examples include: Aliquot, Component, Individual, Piece, Portion, Section, Unit or indeed anything the user thinks is appropriate for the item being described. The use of subsample aliases make the RSINV extremely flexible and allow it to be used for tracking almost any physical or conceptual entity. Metadata for a set of subsamples is primarily displayed in the parent sample details panel, but each individual subsample can also have its own additional details recorded in the subsample details panel.Tags - similar to key words. Metadata that can help to categorize, label and locate items and documents in RSpace. RSpace features a sophisticated tagging system that can be used to label things consistently accross projects, labs and even accross the whole research sector within which you work. Learn more about tags here.Top-Level Container - A Top-Level container is one that cannot be placed inside any other container and which represents a major, typically immobile storage area. Examples might include freezers, rooms, buildings, or entire storage facilities. To designate a new container as "Top-Level" , create a new container > locate the new container on your bench > select the container and click "Move" > click "Make Top-Level" in the popup "Move" dialog. At any time, users can click the "Containers" main filter button in the left hand sidebar to see a list of all toplevel containers to which you have access.How did we do?Related ArticlesGlossaryeCAT 🧪Navigate Inventory 🧪(opens in a new tab)Powered by HelpDocs(opens in a new tab)×ContactSend

Crucially, the password (whether entered or generated) and username must either be known to the prospective user already – for example, if they supplied them – or must be stored outside of RSpace to be communicated to them, as they will need to be able to log in using their credentials.Once a username has been created, it cannot be changed, so it may be important to think about any special username format conventions your organization wants to use before you begin the process of user creation.Each new user may require the Sysadmin to perform additional steps, such as creating a LabGroup for a PI, or assigning a standard user to a LabGroup. System Admins can be created with only basic details, as their remit is deployment-wide. System Admins should not be added to LabGroups, should not contribute data, and should not be used as Principal Investigators.Once the user details have been entered, click ‘Create’ and the user is added to the system. You can go back to the 'Users' area and sort by date created to make sure that you see any new accounts. Users added in error can immediately disabled, or if your server has been configured to allow it, accounts with errors can be deleted.Note that the system admin can adjust the roles of some users: Standard users can be granted the role of PI, LabAdmin or 'LabAdmin with view-all permission' (also called a senior LabAdmin), or, users with those roles can be converted to a standard user. However none of these user types can be converted to an RSpace System Admin (Sysadmin) or a Community Admin, nor are the Sysadmin or Community Admin roles interchangeable. These administrative accounts must be created specially for named users. If a user is to act as both a contributing scientist AND a Sysadmin or Community admin they will need TWO separate accounts.Note also that although an email address is required, it can be anything you like and can be edited at any time, since it is not used in the authentication proccess and is merely used to allow the server to send notifications to users. Every user in the system MUST have a unique email address, i.e., no two user accounts can have the same email address, even if both user accounts are actually used by the same person.Your server can also be configured by Research Space to enable convenient "self-signup" (with or without user-by-user approval) so that users can create their own accounts when they visit RSpace for the first time. Talk to your trainer during your live Sysadmin training to decide which option is best for you.You can only create new users if you have available seat licences. To see how many available seats you have the system admin can look at the top of the System > Users page:If you have recently purchased additional seats for your server but your user page still shows zero available seats, try clicking System > Maintenance > Reload license to force RSpace to contact our online database and update your number of available seats:Batch User UploadIf you want to create more than a few users, consider using Batch User Registration.How did we do?Related ArticlesSetting up Single Sign-On AuthenticationManaging Users (for System Admins)Resetting a user's password (for System Admins)(opens in a new tab)Powered by HelpDocs(opens in a new tab)×ContactSend

In RSpace Community, anyone can designate themselves as a PI but in RSpace Team and Enterprise, PIs are created, revoked and assigned to LabGroups by the System Admin (sysadmin). The sysadmin can also change the PI for a given LabGroup and adjust the LabGroup membership as needed.As System Admin, you have authority to create both PIs (Principal Investigators) and LabGroups.PIs and LabGroups are closely connected:While it is possible to create PI users without allocating them a LabGroup, they have no significant powers beyond any other user until they are connected to a LabGroup.LabGroups cannot be created or exist without an allocated PI.RSpace is flexible; You can either choose to create a new LabGroup at the same time as creating the user who is to be its PI, or you can choose to create the group later – and in more detail – and allocate an already-created PI user to manage it.LabGroups can be used in a variety of ways. They can be permanent or transient to assist with management of things like short term projects. LabGroups may exist as a flat list with no overlapping members, or as more complex Venn diagrams or concentric, nested sets representing subgroups. Since data access is based on LabGroup membership, LabGroups can be organized to allow any complex data access schema required for your organization.Creating a LabGroup when creating a PI user accountTo create a new LabGroup during the creation of a new user account:Click on the System tabClick on Create accountChoose PI as the role for the userYou can then specify a name for the new group to be created, with this user as the PI. You can also optionally choose a community for the LabGroup.This will cause both the PI user and their group to be added to the system. But, the new group will have no members except its PI, and it will be their responsibility to log on, open their group administration page and begin inviting other users to join the group.Creating a LabGroup and assigning an existing PI userCreating a group in this way will require the intended PI to already be registered as a user on the system and to have the role of PI.To create a LabGroup:Click on the System tabClick on GroupsClick on New LabGroupThis will open the 'Create and configure a new LabGroup' form. You can give the group a name:You can then add a PI to the group, by searching for them in the left panel, and clicking on a checkbox:Then using the right arrow in the middle to assign them to this LabGroup.If you do not see any PIs in the list in the top section, then you will need to go back to the user area select a user, and use the "Grant PI role" button to create PIs as needed.You can then select LabGroup members, from the pool of existing users; this step is optional, as LabGroup members can always be added later. You can search the list of available users using the searchbox on the left panel, select them using the checkboxes, and assign them to this group using the right arrow in the middle.You can also unassign specific or all users using the lower two arrows in between the panels.Clicking on a user opens their profile.Finally, click on Submit to create the LabGroup.This initial membership and allocation of roles (such as making users LabAdmins) can then be managed by the PI when they log in and access the group’s page.It's also possible to configure your server to allow PIs to create their own LabGroupsChanging the PI of a LabGroupTo change the PI within a group, the group must first have at least 2 members with the role of PI. If the group only has one member with the PI role, then that role must first be granted to at least one other memeber before the PI of the group can be changed by the sysadmin using the "change PI" button on the System > Groups > LabGroup page.Dispanding a LabGroupThe sysadmin can dispand a LabGroup at any time by selecting the LabGroup in System > Groups and clicking "delete group". Note that no data is deleted when this option is used, but the shared data folder for the group is removed, and all previously shared data reverts to being accessible only to the owner of that data.Creation of a Project Group by the System AdminSystem admins can create Project Groups using the exact same procedure as any other user (described above). There is no special mechanism for this in the System Administrator's "System Tab". After creating a Project Group with themselves as the Group Owner, the System Admin will typically need to change the Group Owner to one of the other members, and then leave the group.How did we do?Related ArticlesManaging Users (for System Admins)Creating Communities (for System Admins)System Requirements for RSpace (for System Admins)(opens in a new tab)Powered by HelpDocs(opens in a new tab)×ContactSend

They are entirely optional, and for many smaller deployments you might never need to use them. They are mainly useful to help spread the admin load of the sysadmin, by enabling them to delegate to community administrators.Communities are only used to organise LabGroups. Collaboration groups may span across communities and are outside the scope of communities.As a sysadmin user, you can view the list of communities by clicking on the ‘Communities’ button.There is always a default community to which all new LabGroups belong by default, called ‘rs.default.allGroups’. To create a new community, click ‘New Community’:Each community needs to have an administrator – someone to manage groups and new users. The list of available administrators is shown in the bottom left panel. If there are no available admins, you’ll need to go back and create a new RSpace admin user account first ( go to ‘Create Account’ ). On the bottom-right panel is a list of LabGroups that you can add to this community. If you’re not sure which groups to add, you can edit this list later.Once you’ve created a community, the admin is notified by email. The RSpaceAdmin will have similar powers to a sysadmin, but restricted to the users and groups within the community.To subsequently edit a community, click on the link to that Community in the community list:Here you can edit the community profile, move groups between communities, and add or remove community admins.How did we do?Related ArticlesRoles and Capabilities (for Team & Enterprise)Creating and Managing LabGroups (for System Admins)System Requirements for RSpace (for System Admins)(opens in a new tab)Powered by HelpDocs(opens in a new tab)×ContactSend

There is a button in top right of the Create Account page that will navigate you to Batch Registration view.You can either specify the entities manually through the form on the page, or specify and upload a list in comma-separated format (CSV).CSV is useful if the required role and group structure is known in advance for a set of users and can be prepared (or generated) offline. The ‘CSV input’ page has a link to example CSV file explaining the syntax.After uploading CSV input, or going through ‘Manual Creation’ page and adding a few entities, you will see a list of Users, Groups and Communities to be created.At this point you can modify the entries, remove them or add new ones. Nothing is created until you click ‘Create All’ button at the bottom of the page. After you are satisfied that the list of users, groups or communities is right click that button.If there are some validation problem with your data the error messages will be displayed in ‘Status’ column of the problematic rows.After validation problems are fixed the import will start, and after a while you’ll see the summary.How did we do?Related ArticlesSystem Requirements for RSpace (for System Admins)System Wide Search  (for System Admins)LDAP Integration (for System Admins)(opens in a new tab)Powered by HelpDocs(opens in a new tab)×ContactSend

You should login as a Sysadmin or Community Admin ONLY when you want to perform administrative tasks. If you act as both a user or PI in RSpace, AND you are ALSO a Sysadmin or Community admin, then you will need TWO separate accounts and should only log in with the appropriate account when you need to perform tasks related to those different roles. Note:System Admin seats are not counted as part of your paid user seats.We usually recommend that most servers have at least TWO system admins in case one of them is unavailable when they are needed for some urgent administrative taskWe recommend that system admin account usernames be assigned to a specific person whose real name is included with the account details and that system admin accounts are not shared. This makes it easier to determine which system admin has performed which administrative tasks by searching the audit trail.Do not add production data when logged in as a Sysadmin, or Community Admin, do not add Admins to any LabGroups, and do not ever try to use sysadmin account to fill the PI or standard user role.Enabling/disabling user accountsUsers can be created, enabled or disabled by the RSpace system admin using the System > Users page. Your server can also be configured by Research Space to enable convenient "self-signup" (with or without user-by-user approval) so that users can create their own accounts when they visit the server for the first time. Talk to your trainer during your live Sysadmin training to decide which option is best for you.The System > Users page displays your list of users and your current total of "Billable" (i.e. enabled) users and the number of remaining available seats on your license:When users are signed up and their account activated, their account is enabled. This is the standard user state and means that:The user can login and view/edit their data.The user appears in Group and Directory listings.The user counts towards the license seat allocation.Sometimes you might want to disable a user account, because someone has left your organization, or you want to adjust the available license seats, e.g. for rotation students.To disable an account, search for the user in the System->Users page, then select the checkbox next to their name, and click the ‘Disable’ button that appears. Enabled usernames are colored green Once their account is disabled, their username will be colored red. The user will also receive an email notifying them that their account is disabled.The consequences of a disabled account are :User can no longer login.User does not appear in directory or Group listings.User cannot be invited to join a group.User does not count towards license seat allocation.Documents that the user has shared with others will continue to be readable or editable.See also Long-term Data ManagementTo re-enable an account, search for the user in the System->Users page, then select the checkbox next to their name, and click the ‘Enable’ button that appears. Once re-enabled, their username will be displayed in green again, and their full account activity restored.Some RSpace servers may be configured to allow the System Admin to see both a "Disable" and a "Delete User" button when a user is selected on the user management page. System Admins should NEVER delete any user account unless there is a compelling legal, data management or technical reason to do so. You can ask Research Space to hide the "Delete User" button on your server if you don't want to offer that option to your System Admin.Operating as another userSometimes a user needs help or is experiencing a problem, and you might want to see the exact page that the user is seeing in order to investigate and help. This can be especially useful in the following situations:You need to help a user change there password (on non-SSO servers).You need to help a user change there email address or other profile information.At the request of a PI, you need to change the sharing and data access setup for a user who has left your organization.To perform these sorts of tasks, you can temporarily operate as that user, with exactly the same rights and permissions that they have.Note that to use "operate as" to work on a disabled user's inventory items, you may need to temporarily enable that user.StepsGo to the System pageClick on Operate AsA popup panel will appear. Fill in the name of the user you wish to impersonate, and select them from the dropdown options that appear.You can choose whether the user will receive an email informing them that you are impersonating them – the default is that the system will do so, to give the user a polite notification. If you wish to operate without the user knowing, check the checkbox for Operate incognito.Fill in your own sysadmin password, then click on Submit.The page will redirect to the user’s home page and you will see a grey notice at the top reminding you that you’re using someone else’s account.When you’re done, click Release in the top bar, or just logout if you’ve finished your session.Please be very careful about editing anything while operating as another user – although any changes will be attributed to you in the audit trail and revision history, it may cause concern to the user that you’re impersonating if they're not aware of it.Contacting all usersYou might wish to contact all users in the case of a system-wide announcement, eg. telling users to export their data if you are migrating from a test server. You can do so using Messaging, by clicking on Send a message in the Workspace toolbar:Then, selecting "Message to all users" in the Request type. By default all message preferences are enabled, so a user who has not used the system will still get the message by email.Unlocking a locked user accountIf a user enters the wrong login credentials too many times, they get locked out for a short amount of time. However, a sysadmin can instantly unlock a user account if that is required, by going into the System tab, searching for the locked user (who will have a black padlock next to their username), selecting the checkbox, then clicking on "Unlock account" in the menu that appears.Promoting a user to PIOccasionally you will have a user with ‘User’ role who becomes a PI with their own lab group. You can promote this user within RSpace so that they have their own lab group. To do this:StepsGo to System->Users pageSearch for, and select the user who you wish to promoteClick on the ‘Promote to PI’ button.The user will now acquire a PI role, and have a LabGroup created for them. He can now invite his lab members to join the group.The consequences of this action are:The new PI will be removed from existing lab groups, and any documents he had previously shared will be unshared.The  PI of his old  lab group (if he was in one) will no longer be able to see the new PI’s work.Deleting a userIf your server has the deleteUser.enabled property enabled, then the system administrator will see a Delete button next to the usual "Disable" button and can use this to completely delete a user and all their work.You should be absolutely sure there is nothing worth preserving before deleting a user – it is totally irreversible and physically deletes the user and all their work from the database. You can export and archive a copy of the user's data first if necessaryTypical use-cases might be:There is a mistake or a typing error in the details of a recently created account (eg. wrong username)You create a user account for the wrong personYou are required to delete all of a user's data for legal or privacy purposesIf a user you wish to delete has created some content, consider exporting their work in HTML and/or XML format, so that their data will be preserved.StepsNavigate to System->Users page.Search for or browse to the user you want to delete.Select the checkbox by their name.Click ‘Delete User’ and confirm.RSpace will confirm whether user removal was successful.Currently, you can’t delete a user with Sysadmin or Community Admin role. Also, because of the irreversible nature of this deletion, you can only delete one user at a time.If the ‘Delete User’ button does not appear, this is because the deleteUser.enabled property is set to false (the default). To enable this, edit your deployment.properties file on the server, so that:deleteUser.enabled=trueand restart the server.Deletion SafeguardIn version 1.51 we add an extra safeguard for backing up user data when a user is deleting. We do this by creating an XML zip of the user’s work that is generating when the user is deleted – this provides additional backup in case of accidental deletion, as most of a users work can be restored from the archive.How did we do?Related ArticlesRoles and Capabilities (for Team & Enterprise)Create New Users (for System Admins)Creating and Managing LabGroups (for System Admins)(opens in a new tab)Powered by HelpDocs(opens in a new tab)×ContactSend

However, through the Maintenance tab you can give your users notice of forthcoming downtime, for example for a server restart or update.StepsGo to System->MaintenanceClick on the ‘Schedule downtime’ submenuSet the times the server will be down for, and an optional message. If you need to urgently update, then you can  prevent users logging in with immediate effect.Once set, users will see this information at the top of any RSpace page.10 minutes before the downtime is due to start, further logins will be prevented, and users will see an alert warning them to finish their work and log off.You can cancel or edit this downtime period from the same page.If you want to login to RSpace yourself during the downtime period, there is a special URL /login?maintenanceLogin which will enable you, as a sysadmin, to login. For example, if you schedule 1 hour downtime, but the upgrade is complete in 10 minutes, you might want to cancel the downtime so that users can continue with their work.Error reportingIf a user reports an error, you might want to view the error log or send the server logs to RSpace support. This feature is a merely a convenience feature to view the server logs from within the RSpace application.In order for this to work, the deployment property TODO should be set to the location of the server error file. This will be in one of two locations, depending on your RSpace version:For 1.30 or earlier, the file will be TOMCAT/logs/catalina.out, where TOMCAT is the top-level folder of your Tomcat installFor 1.31 or later, the file will called ‘error.log’ and will be in the folder specified by the deployment property logging.dir. If this is not explicitly set, the file will be in TOMCAT folder by default.Once the server has been started with these deployment properties correctly set,  you will be able to view logs or send them to RSpace via the System->Maintenance page. These pages only show the most recent logs, so if the reported error cannot be reproduced, or is old,  you might need to investigate the server logs on the server itself.As of version 1.35 Information on versions of RSpace components are logged on startup for reference when reporting issues.MonitoringThe  Monitoring page, introduced in 1.30, replaces the old ‘Performance’ page  with  more comprehensive and reliable information concerning CPU usage, memory consumption, and throughput. From these graphs, you will be able to tell the load thesystem is under, when the peaks of activity are, to help with your resource planning. This page is available through the System->Monitoring menu.How did we do?Related ArticlesSystem Requirements for RSpace (for System Admins)Creating and Managing LabGroups (for System Admins)System Wide Search  (for System Admins)(opens in a new tab)Powered by HelpDocs(opens in a new tab)×ContactSend

In the context of RSpace Enterprise, LDAP is an external service that can be queried to get information about users and groups defined by a given institution or lab. RSpace can also use LDAP authentication mechanism to provide single sign-on experience. To connect to LDAP outside RSpace you need an external client or LDAP browser.Non-technical summaryAlthough the needs of individual institutions and labs vary, the following example illustrates a common use case for LDAP integration with RSpace Enterprise. Institution ABC Inc. already manages their users through Active Directory. Every individual at ABC Inc. has Active Directory credentials with which they can log in to their computer, network, shared drives, etc. Because Active Directory can be queried through LDAP, once ABC Inc. adopts RSpace Enterprise, it is possible to retrieve the user details for the new RSpace users from ABC Inc. and create/update their account details automatically on their first login attempt. Users created this way are subsequently authenticated by their Active Directory credentials, which means they don't need to remember additional password just for RSpace.Required RSpace configurationTo get your lab set up with LDAP integration for RSpace Enterprise, contact us at support@researchspace.com, or chat with us directly from within RSpace via Intercom.See also Setting up LDAP.How did we do?Related ArticlesSystem Requirements for RSpace (for System Admins)System Wide Search  (for System Admins)Managing Users (for System Admins)(opens in a new tab)Powered by HelpDocs(opens in a new tab)×ContactSend

By default the sysadmin will have read-only access to search results, unless the original creator has granted them additional permissions.In order to conduct a system wide search the sysadmin simply types in the term they wish to search for, and selects ‘All’ from the drop down menu as shown below.Due to the potentially vast number of results that may be generated, search terms must fulfill the following criteria:No wildcards (? or *) allowed in search termSearch term must be >= 5 charactersSysadmin searches may also use filters just like searches by individuals.For tips on searches within RSpace, check out our advanced searching documentation here.How did we do?Related ArticlesSystem Requirements for RSpace (for System Admins)LDAP Integration (for System Admins)Managing Users (for System Admins)(opens in a new tab)Powered by HelpDocs(opens in a new tab)×ContactSend

See Export Options, Export Formats for more information.When the grace period is over, Research Space will make a point-in-time image copy of the instance, and then terminate the instance. Customers will no longer be able to access their instance or data, but can request the image taken is made available in exceptional circumstances, in order for them to export anything else required. Further liaisons with the customer will take place when all the data required has been obtained.30 days after the grace period (44 days after the license expiry date), the instance (if still running) will be terminated, all S3 bucket data will be erased, and any images taken of the instance will be deleted. We will also remove appropriate DNS records at this point.

Advice for performing backups (on-prem installations) - RSpace Help                        Contact us                                              RSpace Website                      Contact                    All Categories                                    ​ > ​                      ​For System Administrators                        ​ > ​                    ​Maintenance notes for on-prem IT                  ​ > ​                    Advice for performing backups (on-prem installations)                Advice for performing backups (on-prem installations)                            Updated 1 year ago                                                      by                            RSpace Support                          For on-premises deployments of RSpace, backup is solely the customer's responsibility. This is only general advice regarding different backup methods. ResearchSpace is not affiliated with any of the tools listed in this article.Depending on your IT infrastructure setup, backup advice can vary. While ResearchSpace is not responsible for backups of on-premises deployments and installations, we understand that backups are an important factor when choosing and operating a software solution.We have created this document to advise on the different ways possible to backup your RSpace deployment. This document is general advice regarding different backup methods. Backup and restore plans should always be discussed with your IT team.Did you know you can also backup specific documents or all the data of a specific user via the export function. You can read more about this here or if you're interested in performing this via the API hereWhat should be included in a backupAll of these are should be backed up regularly (at least nightly). The file locations below are standard location, however please double check as in non-standard installs they may be different.RSpace Database (MySQL & MariaDB) - /var/lib/mysqlThe "mysqldump" tool can also be used to backup databasesNewer versions of RSpace use MariaDB while older versions use MySQLThe RSpace filestore - /media/rspace/file_store/RSpace Log files - /media/rspace/logs-audit/RSpace configuration & application files - /etc/rspace/Running RSpace on bare-metalIf you're running RSpace on a Linux bare-metal install (a physical server hosting RSpace) then your backup options are as follows:Using a commercial backup tool such as Veeam to backup the log files, RSpace configuration, RSpace filestore and the RSpace databaseUsing open-source software such as rclone or rsync to backup the log files, RSpace configuration, RSpace filestore and the RSpace databaseThis only performs a backup of RSpace, it doesn't backup the operating system. Databases can also be backed up with the mysqldump toolBackups can be saved to a backup server, different disk or cloud service depending on the backup solution chosenRunning RSpace on a hypervisorIf you're running RSpace inside of a virtualized Linux operating system, then in addition to the backup methods listed in the bare-metal section you can also use specific hypervisor backup tools.This has the added benefit of backing up the whole operating system and not just RSpace. Hypervisor backup tools can be provided by the hypervisor developer or by a third party company and each hypervisor provides different backup / restore tools. Consult your hypervisors documentation regarding this.Testing BackupsYou should test backups regularly as suggested by your IT team or provider. Many of the tools include automated restore functions that can test backup integrity, however it's always recommended to perform simulation restores to ensure that backups will be fully functional in the event of restoration.How did we do?Related ArticlesAdditional useful articles for IT staffOther useful articles for IT staffUpdating SSL certificates (on-prem installations)(opens in a new tab)Powered by HelpDocs(opens in a new tab)×ContactSend

Updating SSL certificates (on-prem installations) - RSpace Help                        Contact us                                              RSpace Website                      Contact                    All Categories                                    ​ > ​                      ​For System Administrators                        ​ > ​                    ​Maintenance notes for on-prem IT                  ​ > ​                    Updating SSL certificates (on-prem installations)                Updating SSL certificates (on-prem installations)                            Updated 1 year ago                                                      by                            RSpace Support                          The certificate bundle is issued by your certificate authority in a .zip file format consisting of several .csr files, these files in addition with the private key & CSR generated before the purchase of a certificate are needed to complete installation of the SSL certificate onto the server.RSpace uses Apache Web Server to handle HTTPS connections before they are passed on to the RSpace application, so SSL configuration is handled by Apache (the apache2 package on Ubuntu).As a base you’ll have 3 files from your certificate authority.key file – This will contain our private key generated before the certificate purchase.csr certificate – This is your actual SSL certificateCA_bundle – This is the root signing certificateYou’ll need to transfer these files to your server. By default SSL certificates are kept in the /etc/apache2/ssl/ directory so that’s where your new certificates should go.The new SSL certificates can be transfered to your server in many ways depending on your server configuration. This may include a file transfer or other options. Consult your IT team on the best way to transfer your certificates to your on-prem serverOnce your certificate files are copied to the /etc/apache2/ssl/ directory, you need to edit the Apache configuration file, this is so Apache knows to use the updated certificates.Navigate to your Apache configuration located in the /etc/apache2/sites-enabled/ directory. The file will be called something along the lines of rspace.conf or rspace-standalone.conf, you can go ahead and make a copy of that file as a backup and then open our config file with a text editor like nano or vim.You’ll already have the SSL configuration details in this file, because you're only updating the SSL certificate and not setting up SSL for the first time. Inside of this configuration file you’re only really interested in a few lines, specifically inside the <VirtualHost *:443> area.For the purposes of this doc, our old certificates are named "docs-demo" and our new certificates are named "new-docs-demo"There are 3 lines you need to edit to reflect the newly copied certificates 👇SSLCertificateFile /etc/apache2/ssl/docs-demo.researchspace.com.crtSSLCertificateKeyFile /etc/apache2/ssl/docs-demo-researchspace.keySSLCertificateChainFile /etc/apache2/ssl/docs-demo-gd_bundle-g2-g1.crtYou need to change these 3 paths to point to the new certificates, so in my case I’ll change them to 👇SSLCertificateFile /etc/apache2/ssl/new-docs-demo.researchspace.com.crtSSLCertificateKeyFile /etc/apache2/ssl/new-docs-demo-researchspace.keySSLCertificateChainFile /etc/apache2/ssl/new-docs-demo-gd_bundle-g2-g1.crtIt is essential to ensure that the tab formatting in your config file stays the same, your config file should look like the image below:Once you've done that, Apache will know to use the new certificates. You can save our updated configuration file and return back to the terminal.You now need to run just two more commands:Run the command apachectl configtest – This tests our configuration file to ensure the formatting has been kept correct Run the command sudo systemctl restart apache2 – This restarts the Apache service, since the service needs to be restarted for configuration changes to take effect.If you get an error message such as a syntax error or failure to restart the service after running any of the 2 commands above, it's likely that the formatting on the config file has been modified in a way Apache doesn't like. Check your .conf file and ensure all formatting is correct.Once the service has restarted your server will use the updated SSL certificates and you've successfully updated the SSL certificates on your RSpace server!If you encounter any issues or require further information then you're always welcome to contact RSpace support.How did we do?Related ArticlesAdvice for performing backups (on-prem installations)Installation of RSpace add-on servicesUpdating from openJDK 11 LTS to openJDK 17 LTS(opens in a new tab)Powered by HelpDocs(opens in a new tab)×ContactSend

Updating from openJDK 11 LTS to openJDK 17 LTS - RSpace Help                        Contact us                                              RSpace Website                      Contact                    All Categories                                    ​ > ​                      ​For System Administrators                        ​ > ​                    ​Maintenance notes for on-prem IT                  ​ > ​                    Updating from openJDK 11 LTS to openJDK 17 LTS                Updating from openJDK 11 LTS to openJDK 17 LTS                            Updated 2 months ago                                                      by                            RSpace Support                          It is the responsibility of the customer to ensure that software on their on-prem IT infrastructure is kept upto date, this includes system applications such as Tomcat and OpenJDK.RSpace version 1.91 or later is required for OpenJDK 17 to work correctly. RSpace 1.91 and later is NOT compatible with OpenJDK 11.OpenJDK 11 becomes End of Life in September 2023. Please ensure that you update OpenJDK to keep receiving OpenJDK security patches.Before you start, please make sure you have the setenv.sh file setup. If you don't there is a high chance you are just using the default config which is /etc/default/tomcat9 If this is the case for you, then copy the contents of that file into /usr/share/tomcat9/bin/setenv.sh and then restart tomcat.Install the java 17 packagesudo apt install openjdk-17-jre-headlessModify the Setenv fileBefore starting, gracefully stop the tomcat9 service. As a result, this will stop RSpace from running while you perform the steps below.You will be working on this file /usr/share/tomcat9/bin/setenv.sh, please take a backup of the file before making the changes below. This is the location of the file on Ubuntu 20.04 / 22.04 running tomcat9. Open this file with your preferred text editor.Replace "JAVA_HOME=/usr/lib/jvm/java-11-openjdk-amd64" at the top of that file with "JAVA_HOME=/usr/lib/jvm/java-17-openjdk-amd64". If it's not already there, add the latter to the top of your file.There are certain values / flags inside the setenv.sh file that are no longer supported in Java 17. We used to use these when running RSpace on Java 11 so you'll need to remove them. Perform a search for the following flags and remove them if they are found inside the file.-XX:+CMSClassUnloadingEnabled-XX:+UseConcMarkSweepGC-XX:MaxPermSize=256mSome customers may be running other non-supported flags, if tomcat fails to start because of another unsupported flag, systemctl will tell you the flag causing the issue when you perform a "sudo systemctl status tomcat9". If this is the case, remove the flag causing issues and try starting tomcat again.There is a file at "/usr/libexec/tomcat9/tomcat-locate-java.sh" that needs to be updated. Open this file in a text editor and add the following number to this line. Add the number 17, before the number 11 as seen in the example below. Before:  for java_version in 11 10 9 8 After:  for java_version in 17 11 10 9 8You can now start the tomcat service back up, monitor the systemctl status to make sure tomcat is starting correctly. After tomcat has started and RSpace is up, you can check your Java version by running this command:sudo bash /usr/share/tomcat9/bin/version.shIt should tell you that you're running Java (JVM) 17. With that, the update is complete. If you encounter any issues you can email support@researchspace.com for support - Make sure to provide all Catalina, Tomcat and RSpace logs.How did we do?Related ArticlesSystem Requirements for RSpace (for System Admins)Importing Updated Documents from WordRSpace 1.69.33 Update Notes(opens in a new tab)Powered by HelpDocs(opens in a new tab)×ContactSend

If an App is not available, no users will be able to access the App. If the App is available, users can individually choose to enable it or not for their accounts.So, for example, if your institution does not want users to link to information on external filestores such as Dropbox or Box, then you can prevent users from using RSpace’s Box/Dropbox integrations by making these Apps unavailable. (Of course, if a user insists on using Dropbox and manually inserting links to Dropbox into RSpace, that is not something that RSpace can stop).To set up the configuration, navigate to System->Configuration->System SettingsEach setting can be set independently. Most are simple boolean switches.Note that some apps require additional configuration (see table above).How did we do?Related ArticlesOther useful articles for IT staffApps IntroductionCloud Storage Integrations (Google Drive, Dropbox, Box, OneDrive, Egnyte)(opens in a new tab)Powered by HelpDocs(opens in a new tab)×ContactSend

For guidance on using IGSN IDs in Inventory, see Add IGSN Identifiers to your Inventory Items.DataCite MembershipPreliminary steps have to be completed before the integration can be enabled:Your institution will need to become a DataCite Member. If you have any DataCite-specific questions related to membership or IGSN IDs, it is best to contact DataCite directly.Your institution does not need to become a DataCite Service Provider, as RSpace fulfills this role.You will need to create an IGSN ID Catalog Repository. Note that IGSN IDs require a separate repository to be created, so you cannot reuse any current DataCite repositories that are used for DOIs.(Optional) If desired, you can request credentials for registration test servers from DataCite, if you wish to try the integration out on your own RSpace server first. Alternatively, you can use the shared Inventory Test Server to preview the functionality provided.SetupAfter the DataCite Membership steps listed above are completed, a System Administrator can setup the integration within RSpace:Navigate to Inventory.In the sidebar, select Settings. If you do not see this option, please ensure you are logged in as a system administrator.A settings panel will open. The following DataCite credentials are required to enable the integration:Repository Account ID (in the format "ABCD.EFGHIJ". Repository must be only used for IGSN IDs)Repository PasswordRepository Prefix (in the format "10.12345")If you have credentials for the test DataCite servers, you can connect to them by changing the Server URL to "Test". Otherwise, keep the "Production" option.Note that we are currently upgrading the integration with the production server; we'd recommend waiting for release 1.94 to use IGSNs in production.You can also choose whether you wish to Enable the integration right away once you save, or keep it Disabled.Click on Save to save the credentials. You will get a notification that the settings have been successfully updated.You can then use Test Connection to check that your credentials are correct.When you are ready to enable the integration for your institution, select Enabled and Save.You can disable the integration at any time by setting it to Disabled, then clicking Save.How did we do?Related ArticlesAdd IGSN IDs to your Inventory Items 🧪Use Benches in Inventory 🧪Select Items in Inventory 🧪(opens in a new tab)Powered by HelpDocs(opens in a new tab)×ContactSend

SWITCHdrive or SURFdrive), the ownCloud integration will require additional configuration work; file linking will not work without the extra setup. Please arrange a discussion between the managers of the custom system and RSpace in order to properly set up the integration.Aim of this documentThis section explains how, as an RSpace admin, you can set up RSpace to enable users to connect their OwnCloud accounts to their RSpace account.This workflow should be followed if any of these are true:You are using your own OwnCloud server.You are an Enterprise RSpace customer and your RSpace is hosted on-premises with a non researchspace.com domain nameIf your RSpace is hosted by us, it is up to you whether you want us to set up the App, or if you want to do it.This procedure is a one-off step - it does not need to be done for every RSpace user!Pre-requisitesAn admin account on OwncloudAccess to RSpace server in order to set in the client Id and Secret you will acquire from Owncloud.The RSpace server must allow 2-way HTTPS communication with OwncloudSteps on OwncloudStep 1 - Install the OAuth App from OwnCloud marketplaceRSpace uses OAuth 2 protocol to authenticate users to Owncloud. Install the OAuth2 Appand make sure it is enabled by clicking on the 'Apps' section of the Admin panelStep 1a - grant access to RSpace in ownCloud configuration fileOwnCloud has a file called `config.php` for system-wide configuration settings. This might be in /path/to/owncloud/htdocs/config/config.php. You must add RSpace to the list of ''cors.allowed.domains', e.g.cors.allowed.domains=> [          https://myrspace.somewhere.com          ]There is more information about this in ownCloud documentationStep 2 - Register RSpace as an OAuth2 clientStill in Owncloud Admin panel, click on 'User authentication' tab and register your RSpace callback URL. This is the base URL of RSpace followed by owncloud/redirect_uri. For example, if your RSpace URL is https://myrspace.somewhere.com then the redirection URI is https://myrspace.somewhere.com/owncloud/redirect_uri. Then click 'Add'.Once you click 'Add' a client ID and secret will be generated. Note these values.Step 3 - Add client ID and secret to RSpaceIn RSpace, open /etc/rspace/deployment.properties and add the following values, editing the values according to your actual valuesowncloud.url=https://<YOUR_OWNCLOUD_URL>owncloud.server.name=ownCloudowncloud.auth.type=oauthowncloud.client.id=<THE CLIENT ID FROM STEP 2>owncloud.secret=<THE CLIENT SECRET FROM STEP 2>Restart RSpace for the changes to take effect.Step 4 Add RSpace to allowed CORS domains on OwnCloud sideFirst of all, in Owncloud, go to the 'Security' tab in your settings panel and add RSpace to your CORS whitelisted domains, then click Add. For example if your RSpace is at https://myrspace.somwehere.com then add this as a whitelisted domain.Now, ensure ownCloud is enabled within the Apps section. If you can’t see this button then please ask your RSpace Step 5 TestingTo test, you'll need a user account on OwnCloud and RSpace.

Please contact RSpace Support if you need to use it.Aim of this documentThis section explains how, as an RSpace admin, you can set up GoogleCloudProject that enables your RSpace to let users link to their Google Documents directly from within RSpace.You don't need to do this if your RSpace web address has .researchspace.com domain.This is a one-off step - it does not need to be done for every RSpace user!Pre-requisitesA Google account that uses an email address that matches the domain that your RSpace is running on. For example if you are using RSpace at https://myrspace.myorganisation.ac.uk then you would need to have a Google account linked to myname@myorganisation.ac.ukYou might consider using a service email account rather than a personal email account, so that other staff can maintain the App if you leave your organisation, or are away on leave, for example.Access to RSpace server - you will need to set some properties in the RSpace property file (usually in /etc/rspace/deployment.properties). These are described later.Please read all of these instructions before starting, so you have an overview of the scope of the work required.1. Setting up a Google Cloud ProjectThis is required in order to generate API keys and clientIds. You can also configure permissions and a consent screen for users who will connect to GoogleDrive. This documentation assumes little or no knowledge of GCP.Logout of all Google accounts you may currently be using in your browserNavigate to https://console.developers.google.com/apis/dashboard and login using an email address belonging to the same domain as your RSpace.Create a new project by clicking on 'select a project' then 'New project':Give your app a name - this isn't the name that end-users will see, it's just an identifier within GCP console. Then click Create:Wait a few seconds for the App to start. You will see a screen like this:You have now completed the first stage. Next we will enable the Google APIs that the RSpace application requires.Enabling Google APIsClick on the 'Enable APIs and services' shown in the screenshot aboveSearch for 'GooglePicker' API and select it. Don't forget to enable it.You should now have this enabled:Obtaining an API keyNow, we have to obtain credentials, starting with an API key Click on the 'Credentials' tab on the left-hand side of the screenshot above.Click on 'Create Credentials' then 'API key'Once the key is created, click on 'Restrict key':In the 'Application restrictions' restrict to HTTP usage:In 'website restrictions' restrict to the URL of your RSpace installation:Click 'Save' at the bottom of the page.Your API key should now appear in the 'Credentials' section:You'll probably see a warning to configure your consent screen - click on 'Configure Consent screen' and select your 'User Type'. If you have a GSuite paid-for Google account, you will be able to choose 'Internal application', otherwise only 'External' is possible:Note that if you choose 'External' UserType, Google will want to verify that you own the domain that you are configuring the application for. If the App has less than 100 users, it will enable people to use the App, but will show many warnings about requiring verification. It will block usage altogether once the limit of 100 users has been reached.Here we assume that you have chosen 'External', then 'Create'. Fill in the details on the OAuth consent screen. RSpace users will see the details on this screen when they access Google from RSpace for the first time. The 'authorised domains' must match the domain of your RSpace URL. At a minimum, the name of the app and the authorised domains must be completed.If your RSpace URL is https://myrspace.mydomain.com, then 'rspace.mydomain.com' should be entered as an authorised domainOnce you have added details, then click 'Save' and your OAuth consent screen is complete. Note the information about the user cap.Creating OAuth Client IdThe final step inside GCP console is to create an OAuth client ID.Go to the 'Credentials' tab, then 'Create new credentials' and choose 'OAuth client ID' to see the following form:Select 'Web application' as the Application typeIn the 'restrictions' section, add the URL to your RSpace in both 'Authorised Javascript Origins' and 'Authorised redirect URIs'. Click 'Create' and you should see the confirmation screen:RecapYou have now :Created A Google Cloud ProjectGenerated an API key for the project and restricted its use to your RSpace web applicationConfigured a consent screen that users will see when they connect to GoogleDrive from RSpaceCreated an OAuth client Id.In the Credentials section of your GCP console you should now see something like this:Setting up RSpaceYou will need your OAuth Client Id and API key which you can obtain from the above screen.Access the RSpace serverOpen /etc/rspace/deployment.propertiesAdd the following properties to the end of your property file:googledrive.developer.key=MY_DEVELOPER_KEYgoogledrive.client.id=MY CLIENT IDRestart RSpaceIf you prefer, Research Space staff can perform this step if we have access to the server.To test: Login to RSpaceLogout of GoogleGo to 'Apps' page and ensure 'Google App' is enabledCreate a new document or open an existing document and start editing a text field.Click on the Google icon in the editor toolbar ( or do Insert...from Google)You should see a dialog appear to login to Google, after which you should see your OAuth consent screen.After agreeing to let RSpace view your GoogleDrive you should see your GoogleDrive listings appearing in RSpace.You may see warnings about that the application is unverified. If you want these to go away, you will either have to ask Google to verify your application, or use a paid-for GSuite account that allows private applications. This typically requires you to demonstrate ownership of the domain that the App is using.

Group Members can create folders, as well as select a specific folder to share a Document into, but do not have permissions to organise the Shared folder.PIs and LabAdmins can see and search all the work created by members of their LabGroup, while group members don't see other members' work unless it has been explicitly shared with individuals or with the entire group.As a PI, your work is private in your Home folder, and you can also choose to share any of your work with individuals or the group.View and Search Shared ContentYou can use the Shared with me filter in the Workspace toolbar to view shared documents:You can also use the LabGroup records to access the Shared folders of all the LabGroups you are in, and if you are a PI, the Home folders of your group members:You can also access shared folders by browsing within the very last item in your Workspace; the Shared folder, identified with an "S", which contains 4 subfolders:In version 1.90 and higher, shared folders can also be accessed directly from a link in the details page for each LabGroup, Collaboration Group or Project Group:You can also search for a specific shared document like you would normally, or use Advanced Searching to filter documents by owner:Organise Shared ContentPIs and LabAdmins move content around within the LabGroup Shared folder by selecting the checkbox of an item and using the Move action:All LabGroup members can create new folders and share (not move) content into them, but only PIs and LabAdmins can rearrange the content inside of a Shared folder. Similarly, restrictions may also apply to who can create new subfolders and rearrange documents in other types of shared folders too.Learn more about the difference between moving documents within your own workspace and sharing documents into a specific shared destination here.Shared documents can’t be moved from the Shared folder to a user’s Home folder. However, you can export the document as an XML archive and re-import it into RSpace (see Export Options), which will create a clone of the document in your Workspace and register a change of ownership in the audit trail.You can view more in-depth examples of how to structure sharing at Examples of Sharing Scenarios and Project Organisation.How did we do?Related ArticlesGetting Started with RSpace ELNThe PI RoleLabGroups(opens in a new tab)Powered by HelpDocs(opens in a new tab)×ContactSend

Using sub-folders or shared notebooks within the main LabGroup sharing folder to define a project2. Using a separate LabGroup to define a project3. Using a Collaboration Group to define a project4. Using a Project Group to define a projectHere are some examples of how individuals and groups can organise their data. You can read more about how to share at Sharing Content.Basic individual organization in an individual's own workspaceIndividual RSpace documents are arranged in each user’s own Workspace and can be manually organised by that user into folders and/or Notebooks. Project separation and organizational structure here is defined and enforced entirely by the owner. A typical strategy is for top-level folders to represent projects, and within that folder, a user might place one or more notebooks, plus other sub-folders or RSpace documents as needed. If a user moves to a new lab, or exports all their data in XML format, then imports it to a new RSpace server, the individual user's organizational structure of work in their own Workspace is unaffected.Only the owner, the owner's PI, a properly authorized LabAdmin with view permission (assigned by the PI) and the system admin(s) can directly view a user's Workspace by default. PIs and LabAdmins can view the user's Workspace by going into Labgroup records, which contains the Workspaces of all the LabGroup members:The example below shows a user who has two main project folders they created in their Workspace shown in "List View". The folder "robert41 PHD work" contains three Notebooks and an RSpace document.Locating the shared folder for a LabGroupThe main LabGroup Sharing folder contains:Work shared manually from each user in the group, orAll work, automatically shared using the autoshare featureIn the main LabGroup sharing folder, documents can be shared into new or existing folders by any user in the group, with the owner’s choice of either “read” or “edit” access, but documents can be only moved between folders or deleted by the PI or designated LabAdmins.Users can also choose to share entire Notebooks into shared folders, and other users can then contribute to those Notebooks by either 1) creating new documents in their own workspace and sharing into the target Notebook or 2) editing existing documents in the target Notebook if they have edit permission. There are however some restrictions on whether or not documents in Notebooks can later be moved. Generally only a user who is both the owner of the owner of the Notebook and the owner of the target doccument can move items out of a notebook. All other documents will have to be unshared by the owner, and then reshared to the new location.Notebooks are designed to tell a historically accurate narative story of actions performed over time. A shared Notebook is designed as a tool to tell a story that may involve more than one contributor, but the arbiter of the accuracy of that story is the Notebook owner. If you are NOT trying to record the historical narative of a study (i.e. you don't need to know the exact order of actions performed in their historical sequence), then you may be better of organising your shared documents into folders, as these are easier for the PI or the LabAdmins to reorganise later.Project separation and organization in the main LabGroup_SHARED folder is enforced mainly by the folder/Notebook structure defined and enforced by the PI or by designated LabAdmins. All users who are members of the main LabGroup can access all folders and Notebooks in the main shared folder. For a lab with an open culture, the PI might choose to turn on autosharing for all members, so that all work performed in the lab is automatically added to the shared folder, with a named top-level subfolder for each user in the group, and all work accessible to all lab members.In the example below we see how the user "robert41" can access the main sharing folder for the LabGroup they belong to called "Pione", shown in "List View".LabGroup members can also access the same shared folder from the "LabGroup Records" shortcut as seen in "List View":In RSpace version 1.90 or higher you can also reach the main shared folder for each group by clicking the shared folder link on the Group Details page (image below).• Users and PIs who are not members of the LabGroup called "Pione" cannot access this shared folder or its content.• Your RSpace System Admin CAN access this folder (even though they are not a member of this LabGroup) by searching for it based on its RSpace ID number or exact name:Examples of sharing scenarios and project organization• In RSpace, access to documents and notebooks is controlled by LabGroup membership. If you don't belong to a particular LabGroup, you will not be able to see the shared folder for that LabGroup. If you don't belong to ANY LabGroups, you cannot share anything with anyone, nobody else except your RSpace system admin can see your data, and the "Share" button will not appear in your toolbar. This can be useful if a user needs to work in isolation from other users, but most of the time, most users will belong to one or more groups.• Users can belong to a single LabGroup or to many LabGroups. PIs may lead a single LabGroup, or may lead many LabGroups• Your organization can create LabGroups that are arranged as a flat list of non-intersecting sets of users, or concentric nested subgroups, or more complex Venn diagrams. Clever arrangement of LabGroups allows organizations to control access to data very precisely.• Your server can be configured to allow ONLY the System Admin to create new LabGroups or the server can be configured to allow PIs to make new LabGroups without assistance from the System Admin.• LabGroups can represent permanent associations of scientists who always work together, or they may also represent temporary groupings associated with short-term projects and temporary collaborations. LabGroups can be easily created and dispanded by the System Admin.• In addition to standard LabGroups you can belong to Collaboration Groups which tend to be better for collaboration between users who are not in the same LabGroup, with affected PIs having full knowledge of what is being shared.1. Using sub-folders or shared notebooks within the main LabGroup sharing folder to define a projectLet's look at what happens when a user wants to make a specific experiment they performed accessible to others using manual sharing. In this case, the experiment is part of a collaborative project called "NIH R01GM987653 - Gene activation in NASH patients".The image below shows what robert41 sees in their own Workspace using “Tree View". There are 2 main project folders: The first contains a single RSpace document “experiment1”, and the second contains robert41’s PhD research, with 3 Notebooks used to record progress. Only robert41 and his PI can see Robert41’s Workspace by default. The PI in this group has opted not to turn on autosharing, but has asked robert41 to make “experiment1” accessible to other lab members via manual sharing (orange arrow).When robert41 shares “experiment1” with the LabGroup “Pione”, RSpace does not "move" anything. Instead, it creates a new link (also called a shortcut or alias) to that document and places it in a designated shared Notebook "First 4 trials assigned to grad students" created by Pione. The RSpace document “experiment1” can now be accessed in two locations – one managed by robert41 in their Workspace (top) and the other managed by the PI in the Pione_SHARED folder (below). All users in the LabGroup “Pione” can access "First 4 trials assigned to grad students" and “experiment1”, as well as the related experiments 2, 3 and 4 which were contributed to the same shared Notebook by other users. In the image below the user has selected "Tree View".Users with appropriate access can also examine the shared Notebook “First 4 trials assigned to grad students" in "List View" to see the following:Note that in this view, ALL members of the LabGroup "Pione" can see ALL content within the "Pione_SHARED" folder including the owner of each document, its unique ID, and its location within the shared folder hierarchy, as indicated by the breadcrumb trail at the top of the page. It is also immediately apparent from the names in the “owner” column that robert41 has contributed the RSpace Document "experiment1", but other users have contributed the other 3 documents visible in the same shared Notebook.In this case, sorting work into shared folders or notebooks may be a useful way to segregate or organize work into projects, but it does not physically prevent ALL members of LabGroup "Pione" from being able to see the all work in the "Pione_SHARED" folder, even if they are not involved with the project "NIH R01GM987653 - Gene activation in NASH patients".'PI one' can also see the project notebook that they shared in their own Workspace (below), as well as in its shared context in the Pione_SHARED folder:The view above shows List view of Pi one’s workspace. Note that:• An indicator next to the Notebook shows that it is shared.• The organizational structure in PI one’s Workspace does not have to be the same as that in the Pione_SHARED folder. The owner of a document can move the original link to a shared docuemnt anywhere they want without affecting the shared link in the shared location.• PI one has clicked the blue info button next to Notebook icon to see additional information in the info popup. The popup shows that PI one is the owner and that the Notebook is shared. PI one has also added the grant number to the caption area of the notebook for increased searchability.At any time, PI one can visit the My RSpace > My LabGroups and if necessary Change Group > Pione LabGroup details page (or indeed, any LabGroup they lead) to verify membership. This makes it clear who has access to the work in the shared folder Pione_SHARED. From this view the PI can also click on the work folders of individuals in their lab to examine their work more closely (below).2. Using a separate LabGroup to define a projectSometimes work needs to be more completely segregated so that only certain users can access it. In this example, the PI will use a totally separate LabGroup rather than a folder in their main LabGroup to be the defining container for a project.Note that in RSpace Enterprise Edition, the System Admin can create any number of LabGroups, and although sometimes these may be permanent structures, it is also possible to create and disband LabGroups at any time to represent more transient assemblages and collaborations.If "self-service" LabGroup creation is NOT turned on for your server, then the PI must contact their RSpace System Admin and request a new LabGroup for use with the new project. If you are using RSpace Community edition, see instead Creating a New LabGroup.In RSpace Enterprise Edition version 1.77 or newer, if "self-service" LabGroup creation has been enabled by the System Admin, than PIs can create new LabGroups without any need to contact the System Admin using the My RSpace > Create Labgroup tab. This can be especially useful for allowing the PI to create new LabGroups that can be used for scenarios such as:• Creation of new project, where data is segregated and organized within the shared folder of that LabGroup, and access to project data is defined by the LabGroup membership.• Creation of subgroups withn a large LabGroup.• Creation of transient LabGroups used for specific purposes such as teaching a class, gathering data from various LabGroups for export as a single data bundle, or other collaborative or organizational scenarios.In the example below, Pione has created a LabGroup called "confidential project" with only 2 users. Both members can, if they wish, share documents into "confidential project_SHARED".Once the new group has been created, the PI can see the following in the My RSpace > My LabGroups area. If necessary they can use Change Group > confidential project to see the LabGroup details page:Only the two member users can see data shared into this LabGroup’s "confidential project_SHARED" folder. The PI could invite additional members if needed. The PI now makes a sub-folder within the “confidential project_SHARED” area called “Eunjyu’s Data”, creates an empty document called “EJ confidential data” in their Workspace, shares that document into the “Eunjyu’s Data” folder with edit permission, and asks Eunjyu to add / edit / paste her contributions into that document. This allows the PI to retain ownership of project data, even if Eunjyu leaves the LabGroup. All edits are properly attributed to the correct authors regardless of who currently owns the document. In Tree view, Pione’s workspace view now looks like this:Note that if Pione wants fast access to the folder “Eunju Yu’s Data” they can select that folder in list view and add it (or any other shared folder) to their favorites. For PIs with access to many shared folders or notebooks, “Favorites” can be a good place to manage a list of items that are currently of most interest.In this example, the PI created the empty placeholder document “EJ confidential data” as a way to prompt Eunjyu to submit required data, but because the Pione is the original creator and therefore owner of the document, the PI can later opt to remove Eunjyu from the LabGroup “confidential project” which will mean that subsequent work added to that project will not be visible to Eunjyu. However, the revision history for “EJ confidential data” makes it clear when and how Eunjyu contributed, even if she is no longer part of that project-centric LabGroup. It follows that it is often important to decide who should be the owner of shared documents because although CURRENT access to the document is decided by how it is shared, FUTURE access may be decided based on the owner, especially if that document is part of a Notebook.To view the revision history, select “EJ confidential data” and click “Revisions” to see the document history.The revision history is shown. Click “View” to see the edits performed by Eunjyu. Note that the attribution of specific edits to specific authors is also indelibly recorded in the system audit trails and this information cannot be edited or altered.Note that when a standard LabGroup created by either the System Admin or a PI is used to define a project, the PI will be able, by default, to see ALL work of ALL of the Group members who are not PIs. For this reason, users should exercise caution when accepting an invitation to join a new LabGroup that comes from an unfamiliar PI. In general, this scenario is mainly intended for the creation of project-centric LabGroups or subgroups where all members are already supervised by the PI leading the new LabGroup. For projects involving members of 2 or more LabGroups with different PIs, a Collaboration Group may be a better way to define a project while still maintaining the privacy of other work not related to the project.If the project-centric LabGroup was created by a PI using the "self-service" feature, then the same PI can delete the LabGroup when the project is completed. This will delete the SHARED folder for that LabGroup, but all work will still be available in the workspaces of the users who created the work.The PI can also export all the work associated with the project (i.e the content of the LabGroup shared folder) for storage outside of RSpace.3. Using a Collaboration Group to define a projectIn this example, three PIs (real names: Jan Yi, Nadine Bissue, Franz Ferdinand) from three different labs (LabGroup1, LabGroup2 LabGroup3) need to jointly supervise work created as part of a single collaborative project called "ProjectX". However, it's important to all the PIs that although they need to see the work that is part of "ProjectX" they DON'T want their counterparts to be able to see ALL the work of the members of the collaboration who are not already under their oversight.Steps required:1) One of the PIs sends a "Create a Collaboration Group" message to the other two PIs.2) The other PIs accept the invitation. This triggers the creation of the Collaboration group automatically called "Yi-Bissue-Ferdinand-collabGroup" and the creation of a shared folder called "Yi-Bissue-Ferdinand-collabGroup_SHARED" located in Home / Shared / CollaborationGroups.3) Each of the three PIs can now invite specific users who they already supervise to join that LabGroup. The invitation must be accepted by each user before they are added to Yi-Bissue-Ferdinand-collabGroup.4) Members of Yi-Bissue-Ferdinand-collabGroup can now select specific items from their workspace related to "ProjectX" and share those into the Yi-Bissue-Ferdinand-collabGroup_SHARED folder with appropriate read or edit permission.Result:All members of Yi-Bissue-Ferdinand-collabGroup can access the work associated with "ProjectX", but they cannot see other work made by members of this group unless they would normally be able to see that work. As with other LabGroups, PIs and appointed LabAdmins can organize work within Yi-Bissue-Ferdinand-collabGroup_SHARED into a suitable hierarchy.When the project ends, PIs have the option to leave the Collaboration Group, or the System Admin can delete it. This will delete the SHARED folder for that Group, but all work will still be available in the workspaces of the users who created the work.The participating PIs also have the ability to export all the work associated with the project (i.e. the content of the Collaboration Group shared folder) for storage outside of RSpace or re-import to a new location in RSpace.4. Using a Project Group to define a projectIf allowed on your server, Project Groups allow for ad-hoc sharing between two or more users without necessarily involving a PI. Only work shared with the group is visible to all members.Project Groups are designed to allow selective and precise collaboration between users without exposing unshared work between these users. Such groups don't need a PI, and if the user with global PI role joins the Project Group, they are treated as a regular user. No member of the project group gets access to content owned by other members until that content is shared with the group. Your RSpace System Admin may choose to dissallow the use of Project Groups if your organization's policies prevent sharing between users without explicit consent and oversight by a PI.Users can start Project Group themselves, or the can be created or adjusted by System Admin. User who started the Project Group is called the Group Owner. Group owner can invite other users to join a Project Group, remove the current members from the group, or assign Group Owner role to others. In many ways the project groups is the simplest way to precisely share work with other users, but this type of group should only be used where direct oversight of the collaboration by a PI is not required.Steps required:1) Any RSpace user can click My RSpace > "Create Project Group" then name the group, and invite any other RSpace users on the same server to join the group.2) Once the group is created, members can select work from their workspace, click "share" and share documents as usual into the Project Group shared folder.Result:All members of the Project group will be able to access the shared work.

It is however possible to configure your server such that PIs can create their own new LabGroups, and it is also possible to create a special "sharing between labs" groups called a Collaboration Group.Collaboration Groups enable selective collaboration between LabGroups without exposing the unshared work of the users to all participating PIs. This type of Groups is ideal for formal sharing of work between two or more labs when the PIs of all the labs want to be "kept in the loop" as to exactly what is being shared between labs.In a Collaboration Group, PIs of two or more LabGroups agree to create a new, hybrid group containing some or all the members of other standard LabGroups managed by participating PIs. Additional PIs can be invited to join the join a Collaboration Group once it is created. The PIs who are part of a Collaboration Group can still see the work of users they usually manage, plus they can see any work deliberately shared into the Collaboration Group shared folder, but they cannot by default see unshared work of Collaboration Group members that don't belong to one or more of that PI's standard LabGroups. In other words, when a standard user, "user1", joins a Collaboration Group that includes both their own PI, and other PIs from LabGroups that user1 does not belong to (let's call those "collaborating PIs"), this does NOT grant any of the collaborating PIs access to ALL of user1's work. Only items that user1 has intentionally shared with this Collaboration Group are visible to the collaborating PIs.If a PI who is not your manager clicks on your work folder on the Collaboration Group details page, they will be taken to a standard "you do not have permission to see this" page:Apart from the initial setup, working in a Collaboration Group will feel exactly the same as working in regular LabGroup. There is Shared Folder for sharing into, you can share with the whole group or with specific individuals (see Sharing Content), and LabAdmins can be assigned to help keep the shared folder organized. However, for security and privacy reasons LabAdmins with view all permission (indicated with a folder icon in their role indicator) are NOT permitted in Collaboration Groups.Requesting a CollaborationAs a PI, you can request a Collaboration Group from two different locations:In My RSpace > My LabGroups, and click on Create Collaboration GroupOn the Workspace, click on Send a messageFill in the username of the PI you want to form the group with, make sure the request type is set to Create a Collaboration Group, add a message if desired, add a request expiry date if desired (if triggering the request from the Workspace), then click on Send. RSpace will create the Collaboration Group once the PI accepts your request, initially containing only yourself and the PI you invited.Accepting a CollaborationTo accept a collaboration:Open your Received messagesIn the Set Request Status dropdown, select either Accepted or RejectedYou can optionally add a message, then click Update & Reply to confirm. If you chose to accept the request, the Collaboration Group will be created, initially containing yourself and the PI who invited you.Viewing and Inviting Users to a Collaboration GroupAs a PI, you can view the group in My RSpace > My LabGroups. You might need to use Change Group to select the collaboration group:Initially, the group only has the two PIs as members. Either PI can invite people from either LabGroup to join by clicking on Invite at the top of the members list.The newly invited members can then access the group page at My RSpace > My Profile, under the LabGroups section.Inviting a New LabGroup to a Collaboration GroupYou can sent additional collaboration requests by choosing Invite a New PI on the collaboration group page:Leaving a Collaboration GroupAt any time, a participating PI can leave a Collaboration by clicking "Leave Collaboration".If a PI choosese to leave a Collaboration group, ALL work shared into to the Collaboration Group Shared folder by either that PI or by ANY of the users managed by that PI are unshared and removed from the Collaboration Group Shared folder. Other members of the Collaboration Group no longer have access to those items.How did we do?Related ArticlesEnabling Publication of Documents in your Lab GroupPermissions and Sharing in Inventory 🧪The PI Role(opens in a new tab)Powered by HelpDocs(opens in a new tab)×ContactSend

In RSpace Team and RSpace Enterprise, the SysAdmin needs to create or assign a PI to a group.LabGroups can be created to bring together users and their documents in order to promote collaboration and facillitate controlled data access. LabGroups are created with a single PI (Principal Investigator) who can view the work of individual group members and organise the group's shared work. You can read more about LabGroups here.• Users can belong to a single LabGroup or many LabGroups. PIs may lead a single LabGroup, or may lead many LabGroups• You can create LabGroups that are arranged as a flat list of non-intersecting sets of users, or concentric nested subgroups, or more complex Venn diagrams. Clever arrangement of LabGroups allows organizations to control access to data very precisely.• LabGroups can represent permanent associations of scientists who always work together, with shared work organised using folders, or may represent temporary groupings associated with short-term projects.• Some adjustments to LabGroups can only be performed by the RSpace System Admin. On the Community Edition server, ResearchSpace support serves as the System Admin, and can perform these types of adjustments for you. Contact support@researchspace.com if you need assistance.Creating a GroupIn RSpace Team and RSpace Enterprise Editions, PIs are designated by the System Admin and LabGroups are either created by and managed by the System Admin, or the System Admin can grant PIs the ability make new LabGroups.In the Community Edition, every user has an option to create a group and nominate PIs and an existing LabGroup PI can create groups with themselves or someone else as PI. To create a new LabGroup on the Community Edition server follow these steps:Navigate to the My RSpace tabClick on Create LabGroupClick on Create GroupChoose a descriptive name for the group, then click on NextNext, select whether to make yourself PI or to nominate someone else, then click on Next. Any group created will require a PI as a point of contact and basic administration purposes. For more information about LabGroups and roles, see LabGroups.Creating a new LabGroup with yourself as PI will instantly generate a group on the system and contact anyone you have chosen to invite to be group members by email (both registered RSpace users and/or external addresses can be contacted).If nominating someone else as PI, enter the e-mail of the individual you wish to invite as PI into the box which appears – RSpace autocomplete will offer options of known users as you type, or you can enter the full address of any other non-registered individual (they will be asked to sign up to RSpace before becoming a PI). You will become a LabAdmin for this group.Please note that if selecting someone else as a PI, the group will not be created and invitations to potential members will not be sent until the PI approves the group.Add emails to the invitations list to invite members when the LabGroup is created. Entries in the known users box will be autocompleted, and non-registered users can also be invited by typing and entering in the second box. Further users can also be invited any time after the creation process is completed.The final page will display a summary. You can still go back at this stage and change details. After you have reviewed you can then click Create LabGroup to complete the process.You will be notified that your new group has been created. You can then either create another group, or review the newly created group within the My LabGroups section (My RSpace > My LabGroups).How did we do?Related ArticlesGeneral Information on LabGroupsRSpace Community, Team and Enterprise EditionsCreating and Managing LabGroups (for System Admins)(opens in a new tab)Powered by HelpDocs(opens in a new tab)×ContactSend

It is however possible to configure your server such that PIs can create their own new LabGroups.This feature can used by PIs to create "subgroups" or to create LabGroups that segregate work associated with a specific project.System Administrators must enable this on your RSpace instance. The system property self_service_labgroups is initially DENIED and must set to be ALLOWED.Once enabled, any PI can create a LabGroup for the purpose of acting as a Project.Click on ‘My RSpace’. If you are a PI, you should have a ‘create lab groups’ tab.Click on 'create lab groups'. The new page allows you to create a lab group. By default YOU are the PI and you may only invite existing RSpace users. They do not need to be a member of your existing LabGroup. You do not need to invite anyone, the process will still complete.Upon clicking ‘create labgroup’ and completing, a success message appears top right and you will be redirected to your new LabGroup.If you invited users to the Group, you will see a section on the right - ‘Pending Invitations’ - with a list of all invitees. You may cancel any invitation. When someone accepts or rejects the invitation, they are removed from the list - this will be apparent if you refresh the page.The new LabGroup acts in every way like a LabGroup created by an RSpace administrator - all member's data is visible to the PI, except for other PIs who join the LabGroup.You can also delete the group. After clicking on `Delete Group` you will see a confirmation dialog and then be redirected to your profile page.If a system admin transfers the PI role to another PI, the new PI will now acquire the permissions to delete the group.How did we do?Related ArticlesLabGroupsGeneral Information on LabGroupsExporting a LabGroup’s Work(opens in a new tab)Powered by HelpDocs(opens in a new tab)×ContactSend

LabGroups can be created and managed, by the sysadmin, or if your server policies allow it, they can also be created by PIs. A LabGroup must always have a single primary PI (Principal Investigator) who it is assumed is in charge of the group's work. In a LabGroup, the PI can by default see all the work of all the members, except for the work of other group members who have the rank of PI in other LabGroups. The PI may also be granted edit access for all work in the LabGroup too.Collaboration Groups are generally used for fromal collaboration between members of two or more different LabGroups with full knowledge and consent of the PIs. Only work shared with the group is visible to all members.Project Groups if allowed on your server allow for more ad-hoc sharing between two or more users without necessarily involving a PI. Only work shared with the group is visible to all members.In RSpace, access to documents and notebooks is controlled by Group membership. If you don't belong to any Groups, you cannot share anything with anyone, nobody can see your data, and the "Share" button will not appear in your toolbar.How did we do?Related ArticlesLabGroupsPI-created "self-service" LabGroupsExporting a LabGroup’s Work(opens in a new tab)Powered by HelpDocs(opens in a new tab)×ContactSend

The document will not be editable anymore, but will still be available to view.Witnessing a document is signing with further verification of the completed work by other members of the group.SigningTo initiate signing:Open the Document in View mode, and click on the Sign icon in the toolbar. The Sign button will only appear if you are the owner, and the document hasn’t been signed previously.A dialog appears, and you can:Select the first statement if you want the document witnessed, and choose from the list of available witnesses for the document, which will be members of your group(s). They will receive a message asking them to be a witness, with a link to the document.By default, most users will see at least their own PI as a possible witness. If you do not see who you are expecting, or if the witness list is empty, it means that the person or people you want to act as witnesses cannot access the document. Share the document with an appropriate LabGroup or one or more users to add users to the potential witness list.Select the second statement if you want to sign the document by yourself, without requesting witnesses. This action is equivalent to locking the content of the document, so that no further changes can be made to it.Click on Sign at the bottomType in your password to authorise, and click on Proceed to complete signing.The document will no longer be editable and its status will be “Signed”, with information provided in the top-right and bottom-right corners.WitnessingTo witness a document that you have been invited to witness:Click on Received Messages in the Workspace toolbarClick on the document link in the message. You can also decline the request right away using the Set Request status dropdown on the right.Click on on the Witness button in the document toolbar. The button will only appear if the document has been signed, the user was selected as a witness, and if the document has not been witnessed previously by that user.A dialog appears, and you can:Agree to witness the workDecline the request to witness and supply a reason why in the textbox that appearsAfter choosing an option, click on WitnessType in your password to authorise, and click on Proceed to complete witnessingThe document status is changed from "Signed" to "Signed and Witnessed".Additionally, the original signer will receive a notification that the document has been witnessed.View the status of a DocumentClick on the File Info button. Note the signed icon next to signed documents.The Signature Status section will contain information on the signing & witnessing status of the Document.Detailed information is available when the Document is open.When a user with access to the document clicks the "Show" link in checkum status message at the bottom of a signed page, they are given the option to download a special verison of the document in either .pdf, .xml or .html format. These versions are accompanied by SHA-256 checksum values that can be used to verify that a document has not been changed subsequent to signing, even if the exported version is stored outside of RSpace.NotificationsIf you want to receive notifications about the witnessing process, navigate to My RSpace > My Profile, and ensure "A request status changes" is checked under Messaging and Notification Preferences.Reversing the signing or locking processIt is not currently possible to "un-sign" or unlock a signed document. If you make a mistake and you need to make changes to a signed document, you can select it and choose "duplicate" in the workspace. This will create a new unsigned COPY that you can edit. A good best practice would be to add a link to the new copy, linking it to the original with an explanation of why it need to be duplicated and edited. Once corrections have been made you can reinitiate the signing process with the new copy.Locating recently signed documentsYou can quickly locate a list of signed documents you have access to by using the My RSpace > Audit area and selecting the Actions > Sign filter:How did we do?Related ArticlesFile Info ButtonVerification passwordsChangelog - what's new?(opens in a new tab)Powered by HelpDocs(opens in a new tab)×ContactSend

Researchers and team members may come and go over time, and in science, it's often important to build upon past work, access legacy data, or reproduce the results of experiments performed by people who may no longer be part of your lab. RSpace is designed specifically for this purpose.A list of LabGroup members is displayed in the LabGroup management page for your LabGroup. When someone leaves your organization, their account is usually disabled by your RSpace System Admin. Disabled users are automatically moved to a new section in the PI's view of the LabGroup page called "Disabled Users". Disabled users can no longer log in, but their data can be permanently accessed exactly as before, as long as they are not removed from the LabGroup.In many cases, since it is easy to see the data of former lab members by default, when a LabGroup member leaves, no further action may be necessary. However, be sure to consider some of the options and best practices described below.If you are using RSpace Community Edition, then you do not have access to your own RSpace System Admin account. You will need to ask the departing users to send a request to Research Space to disable their accounts.Note that if you are using RSpace Community Edition, the data of disabled users may be deleted after 12 months of inactivity, so if you are a PI, you might want to EXPORT the data of disabled users for permanent storage outside of RSpace, or reimport back into some other active user account.If you are using RSpace Enterprise Edition, Disabled users do not count toward your billable total of licences, and there is no fee for maintaining the data created by disabled users (i.e. former LabGroup members) on your Rspace server forever.If you are using RSpace Enterprise Edition and RSpace is integrated with your institutional SSO system, then it is still a best practice for the RSpace admin to manually disable the accounts of users who have left your organization. However note that even if the account is not disabled, former users will lose access to an SSO authenticated RSpace server once your IT team deactivates their SSO account.The example below shows a single Disabled Account. Over the years, it is likely that the number of disabled users will grow. Eventually there may be many fromer LabGroup members listed, perhaps more even than your list of "current" LabGroup members. Note that in this image you can also see that the PI has access to an "Export Work" button for each user that they can use to easily get a copy of all work by that user.If you are a PI and you notice that a user who has left your organization has NOT been moved to the "Disabled Accounts" section, you should contact the RSpace system admin and remind them that the account needs to be disabled. Your organization pays for all enabled accounts, plus enabled accounts consume a seat license thay could be used for some other user at your organization.If necessary a user can be removed from the group list by clicking the Remove button. Depending on your LabGroup organizational structure, the user's former PI may no longer have access to that work once a user is removed from their LabGroup, however, the user's work continues to be stored on the system for as long as it exists, and remains accessible to the sysadmin and perhaps other colleagues if, for example, they have moved to a new LabGroup. The sysdmin can add the former user BACK to the old LabGroup if necessary (e.g., if a PI clicks "Remove" by mistake), or the System Admin can choose to add the disabled user to any other Group to grant access to the former user's data.Alternatively, a copy of ALL the user's work, or perhaps just some parts of it (e.g., important work located in a specific shared folder or subfolder) can be exported and imported back to the account of some other user. See "Transfer using Export - Import section below".Some RSpace servers may be configured to allow the System Admin to see both a "Disable" and a "Delete User" button when a user is selected on the System tab > Users page. System Admins should not delete user accounts unless there is a compelling legal, data management or technical reason to do so. You can ask ResearchSpace to hide the "Delete User" button on your server if you don't want to offer that option to your sysdmin.Reorganizing data of former usersIt's a good best practice for PIs to meet with departing users to review the following:• Settings for shared data and permissions so that future access is optimized. If necessary, PIs can ask their RSpace sysdmin to assist with adjusting the sharing schema and/or access permissions for former users who are no longer available. The System Admin can do this using the System tab > Operate As feature.• Reorganization of the work if necessary. One common scenario for "reorganization" via moving and selective sharing is to adjust the access of legacy work located in shared notebooks owned by a former user such that the same work will also appear in a newer notebook owned by someone else who has taken over that project. Another strategy might be to unshare ALL work by a departing user, and then use autoshare to reshare it to a single named folder named after the user who has left, so that all of that user's work is available with read-only access in a single location. You can fine more information about various data sharing and management scenarios here. If you forget to ask a user to reorganize work when they leave, you can ask the sysdmin to do it using the System tab > Operate feature.• Export options for the departing user. The user can visit the My RSpace Export-Import page and use "Export all my work" to get a copy in an appropriate format (s) to take with them or to leave with the PI as appropriate.Transfer using Export - ImportUsers (or their PI, or the sysadmin) can also EXPORT a copy of user's data as XML and then reimport it to a different account, (or even a different server). This method may not be ideal though, because it generates a new copy of the data. Generally a good best practice in RSpace is to avoid creating multiple copies of work in the system whenever possible so that you don't later have to deal with ambiguous duplicate results when you use the RSpace search tool to relocate the work, although sometimes this may be unavoidable.How did we do?Related ArticlesRSpace Community, Team and Enterprise EditionsManaging Users (for System Admins)Security(opens in a new tab)Powered by HelpDocs(opens in a new tab)×ContactSend

A stand-alone basic document will expand to contain as much content as you choose to enter.A Basic Document can either be a stand-alone document stored and listed individually in your Workspace, or the building block of notebooks. When used within a notebook, large amounts of content will appear over several pages, while new documents will appear as new entries. See Notebooks for more details.Create a Basic DocumentTo create a new stand-alone Basic Document:Make sure you are in the Workspace view, by clicking on the Workspace tab:Click on the Create button in the toolbarSelect Basic Document from the drop-down menu:Structured DocumentsStructured Documents are documents with a fixed structure of fields designed to hold set content types, and are created based on a stored form. Forms in RSpace are re-usable structure formats which are made available in the Create menu. There are some sample forms available by default, and you can choose to generate and publish your own as well. See Forms for more details.Create a Structured DocumentTo create a new stand-alone structured document:Make sure you are in the Workspace view, by clicking on the Workspace tab:Click on the Create button in the toolbarSelect From Form from the drop-down menu:A pop-up dialog appears with the types of currently available Forms listed in it. Choose a Form from the list, and a Structured Document using that Form will be created.How Forms are placed in this menu is also covered in the Forms article. When working in a notebook, you can also choose a Structured Document from from the Create menu.TemplatesAnother option in the Create menu is ‘From Template’. Templates can be created and re-used by the user. A template serves as a fixed model of both structure and content to simplify the creation of subsequent documents. Basically, they are Forms in that they have a fixed structure of fields that hold specific content types, but additionally, they also hold fixed content in some of these fields.

In the context of a Notebook, RSpace documents are often referred to as Entries. RSpace Notebooks are designed to reproduce the structure of a traditional lab notebook and tell the story of your research by recording a linear sequence of events in such a way as to preserve the historical order of actions performed by one or more users. In order represent your story clearly and accurately, certain restrictions and rules apply to Notebooks. For example, since linear time cannot be broken into subfolders, your Notebook entries can only be arranged in a linear sequence. You can read about how to share or edit permissions of a shared Notebook in Sharing Content. Creating a NotebookTo create a Notebook:On the Workspace, click on CreateSelect NotebookGive the notebook a name, and click on Create.Adding a New EntryThe Create button will only be visible if you are the owner of the Notebook. See Moving Documents into a Shared Notebook below if you want to add an entry to a shared Notebook.To add a new entry to a notebook:Click on Create when viewing the Notebook.Select whether you want to create a New Basic Document entry, or use a Template, Form, or import from Protocols.io or Word.You can then edit and save the document as you normally would; entries can be as long as you like. You can change the entry Name and Tags using the edit icons.You also have the Save & New option, which will save your current entry and directly open up a new one.Moving Documents into NotebooksIf you prefer to watch a video, the process is explained at [Video] Sharing or moving Documents into Notebooks.Moving Documents into an Unshared NotebookYou can only MOVE documents into a Notebook if you are the owner of the Notebook and the document you want to move. In the Workspace, select the checkbox of the DocumentSelect the Move in the context menuSelect the desired destination Notebook, then click on Move.When you open the Notebook, the moved Document is there.Moving a Document into a Notebook does not change its creation date or other metadata. The Notebook pages will remain ordered by their creation date, rather than the date they were added to the Notebook.Moving Documents into a Shared NotebookFollow the instructions for sharing a Document with a group in Sharing Content. After selecting Share with Group, select your Notebook as the destination to share into.Unsharing a Document from a NotebookSimilarly to Documents, unsharing can be done under My RSpace > Shared Documents (read more at Sharing Content).If a shared Notebook owner deletes your Document from the Notebook, this will only unshare it. You will still have access to this Document in your Workspace.Moving Documents Between NotebooksYou can only MOVE documents between Notebooks if you are the owner of the both source Notebook and the document you want to move. To move a Document between unshared Notebooks, use the Move command.To move a Document between shared Notebooks, or to move a Document out of a shared Notebook, you will first need to unshare it, then share it into the desired new location. Notebooks are designed to tell a historically accurate narative story of actions performed over time. A shared Notebook is trying to tell a story that may involve more than one contributor, but the arbiter of the accuracy of that story is the Notebook owner. If you are NOT trying to record the historical narative of a study, then you may be better of organising your shared documents into folders, as these are easier for the PI or the LabAdmins to reorganise later.Sharing a NotebookThe steps to share and unshare a Notebook are the same as for a Document, see Sharing Content. However, permissions work slightly differently with Notebooks.Permissions Within Shared NotebooksNotebooks created within RSpace are owned first and foremost by their creator. It is possible to share your Documents into other people's Notebooks, but this causes you to lose some control over the Document.The sharing behaviour is as follows:All entries within a Notebook are shared with the same read/write permissions as the Notebook, and the Notebook owner can re-share the Notebook with read/write permissions with other users. The Notebook owner can edit any of the entries in the Notebook, both their own and those shared into the Notebook.Both the shared Notebook owner and Document owner can delete and unshare individual entries within the Notebook.The Document owner can unshare to remove the Document from the Notebook.PIs and LabAdmins can unshare the entire Notebook, but not individual Documents within the Notebook.The Document cannot be moved to another Notebook or Folder from within the shared Notebook; it will need to be unshared first. When sharing, the Document metadata and history remains intact.Viewing and Navigating NotebooksNotebook ViewIn the Workspace, click on the Notebook icon to open the Notebook view.You can then navigate the chronological entries using the arrows, swiping on a tablet, or using the entries bar.You can show/hide the entries bar using Show All Entries/Hide All Entries.You can also see the Notebook in Folder view by clicking on the breadcrumb.Folder ViewIf you want to perform a bulk operation such as sharing (see Adding, Moving and Sharing Documents into Notebooks), deleting, exporting several entries (see Export Options), or want to view all entries at once, you can click on the Notebook name in the Workspace.This will open your Notebook as if it was a folder. Clicking on an entry will open it in Notebook view.Searching a NotebookWhen viewing entries, you can use the search bar on the top-right, which supports full-text search of the content of entries, searching by name, and by tags.How did we do?Related Articles[Video] Moving or Sharing Documents into Notebooks[Video] Create a Notebook[Video] Building a notebook page in RSpace(opens in a new tab)Powered by HelpDocs(opens in a new tab)×ContactSend

If you are likely to have some fields which have the same content across several documents, then creating and using a template from a form gives you the ability to have content persist in chosen document fields.Creating a New FormOn the Workspace, click on Create, then New Form. You can also access the editor through My RSpace > Create Form.This opens up the form editor. You can use:Add Field to access the field type popup from which you can create your choice of number, string, text, choice boxes, radio buttons, date, or time fields to the form. Fields might have additional values that can be added, such as a default value, and ranges of acceptable values which are used to validate input into documents created with that form.Reorder Fields to move the fields into the desired orderChange Icon to upload an image to associate with the form, which makes recognising documents created using the form easierSave and Close to save your Form. Note that you need to publish the form to make it available to use (see below)You can change the Name and add Tags in the grey area below the settings described aboveTo edit or delete fields, use the icons at the top-right of each field.Note that the "Text" field is the most widely used and flexible field type. Text fields can be use to create a range of rich content and built-in editing tools, but can also be used in your form to serve as a container into which users can insert data files. The RSpace "Basic Document" form, for example, consists of a single "Text" field that can be used to create a variety of rich unstructured content much like working with a standard word processing document or blank sheet of paper.Once you Save, you will be redirected to the Manage Forms section. A new form is not immediately available for use: you will need to publish it first.Required FieldsEach field can be marked as required to indicate to anyone filling out a document created from the form that they should provide a value for the field. Marking as required has the following effects:A red asterisk is added alongside the name of the field in the document.Signing a document that has required fields that do not have a value is prohibited.A document that has required fields without a value will be displayed in the workspace with a warning icon, which will look like this:To mark a field as required, simply check the "Required?" checkbox in the field edit dialog, followed by saving the field and updating the form. All new documents created from that form will now have the field marked as required.Radios and PicklistsIf you choose 'radio' as the field type to add to your form, you will have the option to display the option values as a dropdown 'picklist'.Of note:Check 'display as picklist' for the resultant form to contain a drop down 'picklist' instead of radio options.Picklists may hold up to 2000 option values. The range of options will be filtered if the user types some initial text:Data for options can be typed manually as before. Then click 'Add new'.Data that contains commas will be split into separate options. Therefore type 'a,b,c,d' to create FOUR options, a, b, c and d.Data can be uploaded from a file. The files a limited to .csv and .txt files. Txt files will be split with each line of text becoming an option. CSV files will be split on lines of text AND any commas.The limit on uploaded file size is max 100kb and max 2000 options generated.Options can be sorted by dragging by hand or click on 'Sort alphabetically' to sort them automatically.When 'sort alphabetically' is checked, adding new option values will result in a resort of the data. Dragging options around manually will not.You can force an alphabetic resort by unchecking 'sort alphabetically' and then rechecking.Rember that changes to forms only happen when the form is 'updated or published'. Choosing to 'save and close' the form will persist the options and choices on 'display as picklist' and 'sort alphabetically'. However, it will not actually update the form that will be used to generate subsequent RSpace documents until 'update/publish' is chosen.Publishing a FormTo publish a form, select the checkbox of your form from within the Manage Forms section, and click on Publish to make the form available for your own use or for others.You can then specify permissions for your form; you can learn more about this under Roles & Permissions with Forms below. Click on OK when you are done. Your form is now published.You can read more about editing published forms under Editing & Managing Forms down below.Add a Form to the Create MenuYou can add a published Form as a shortcut in the Create menu by selecting its checkbox, then selecting Add to Menu.Roles & Permissions with FormsThere are three levels of form access: private, group, and world. Read means a permission to use, while Write means a permission to edit.Private forms can only be used or edited by their creator.Group forms can be used by all members of a group.World (public) forms can be used (but not edited) by anybody.Permissions can be set by the creator of the form in the Manage Forms page of My RSpace – click in the form’s checkbox and select Permissions from the context menu.All forms that can be viewed by a user can also be duplicated to create a new form, which is owned and administered by that user.Creating Documents From FormsDocuments created from forms have numerous fields for the user to enter data into.In order for a form to be made into a document, it must first be published and added to your Create menu. Read the Publishing a Form section above to accomplish this.In the Workspace, select Create, then From FormSelect the form you wish to make your document fromThis will create a document based on your chosen form. You can edit the fields by either double-clicking on them, or clicking on the edit button on the top-right of a field, and save like you would normally in a document.If you wish to add content to fields that will remain the same between experiments (eg. Materials), you may wish to create a template from the form. You can then re-use both the structured fields, and also the shared content of an experiment. You can learn how to create a template from a form at Templates.Editing & Managing FormsManage FormsTo manage Forms, navigate to My RSpace > Manage Forms.The table shows information about each form’s status. Some of the forms are unpublished (and not available to create documents from), but all the other forms are published and are available for use.Clicking on the checkbox of a form gives a contextual menu, with actions dependent on whether the form is published or not:For published forms, the options are: Unpublish, Permissions, Duplicate, and Add/Remove from Menu (Create Menu in the Workplace).For unpublished forms, the options are: Delete, Publish, Permissions, Duplicate.Note that once a form has been published, it can no longer be deleted – only unpublished, which makes it unavailable to other users. Also, Duplicate can be applied to multiple items.The search in the top right corner allows you choose whether you wish to see only your forms or all forms visible to you, and will accept either Form names or Created By searches.Editing a FormClicking on a form’s name will open the form editor. If you don’t have edit permissions on the form, you will get a read-only version.Editing a published form creates a new version of that form. The most recent version of a form will be used to create documents, but earlier versions will be preserved for the documents that were created from these earlier versions. RSpace treats all edits of a form as a new version.When editing an existing published form, edits to a form are not immediately available in the published form. As a form editor, you have three options:Revert – this abandons the new version, deletes it, and returns to the previous version.Save and close – the changes to the form are saved in a temporary form for future editing.Update – commits the form changes to a new version. If the form is published, this new version will be available for creation of new documents. If you forget to click the "Update" then any documents created from the form in the workpace will still use the OLD version of the form and may be missing your most recently added fields or edits.How did we do?Related Articles[Video] Create a Form in RSpaceBasic and Structured DocumentsTemplates(opens in a new tab)Powered by HelpDocs(opens in a new tab)×ContactSend

Documents you have permission to edit open by default in view mode, and you can can read through the content but also easily begin editing. The Document Editor both displays the document for reading and, if you have permission, opens it for editing. It also facilitates making changes to the document’s status such as renaming or adding tags. View mode appears slightly differently if you are viewing stand alone structured or basic documents, or if they are contained as elements of a Notebook. The available buttons in the Document Editor toolbar also change when in view or edit mode, and when in stand-alone documents or Notebooks.When working in a stand-alone structured document, the structure of the document is defined in a series of fields containing specific types of data or content, shown in view mode as slightly-tinted blocks with a defined outline and a defined header. These fields are individually editable: double click within the field to start editing or click / tap the blue edit field icon for any field:Working in basic documents, there is only one field. The default view when opening is a single tinted block, which can be double-clicked to start editing.Notebook entries in view mode do not show the separate blocks of structure. This is so they can be more easily read as a sequence of pages before any decision to edit. Double clicking on the page of any view mode notebook entry will initiate editing: if the entry is a single field basic document, the text editor will open the field for immediate editing; if the entry is a structured document, the document’s field structure will be displayed and any individual field can then be selected for editing.The Document Editor ToolbarWhether you are in view mode or edit mode, in a document or a notebook, the document editor has a top toolbar containing a set of main buttons and an area underneath the toolbar to contain status and identification information about the open document and, in the case of a notebook, mechanisms to navigate within the notebook.The top toolbar buttons include Delete, Share, Export and print. The options for Saving documents are available in this toolbar when editing, and are covered in detail here. At the right of the toolbar, are mesage and notification indicators and a button for creating messages related to this specific document. Other communication buttons (Slack, Teams) may also be available.Beneath the toolbar is an area containing information about the open document. The top row always contains two essential pieces of information: to the left is a breadcrumb trail showing the path to the current document from the ‘home’ location of the top level Workspace, with clickable links to parent folders or notebooks. To the right is an icon and text definition of the document’s current edit status. This status changes when viewing and editing, and also indicates when the document is not currently editable (such as if it is shared and someone else is already editing) or is never editable (such as if the document has been signed and closed for further edits).Information such as document name, Unique ID, access to the info popup (blue "i") and a list of Tags should also be visible. Find out more about tags and tagging here.Notebooks add an additional collapsable navigation area to allow you to select a specific notebook entry and an additional search tool to allow searching withing the current notebook:How did we do?Related ArticlesResponsive Tree ViewTooltipsEnabling and Using the JoVe Integration(opens in a new tab)Powered by HelpDocs(opens in a new tab)×ContactSend

Autosaves are not explicit actions in the revision history, which are only created when the user actively uses one of the options in the Save menu. There are several different ways to save a document from a Save menu. Each option is described below:Save will save the document and make a new revision in the revision history, but keep you in edit mode.Save and Close works like Save, but instead closes the document and returns you to the Workspace view of your documents and folders.Save and Clone will save the current document, make make an identical copy of it, and open the copy for editing. (This is convenient when creating many documents with similar content.)Save and New will save the current document, and open a new empty document of the same type for editing. (This is convenient when creating many documents derived from the same form.)These saving options are available in the top toolbar menu of documents and notebooks, but also under the File menu of the Text Editor and in the non-text fields of structured documents when the field has been opened to edit.How did we do?Related ArticlesExport OptionsHow does RSpace store files?

The editor’s features can be accessed from both one-click icons (mouse-over the icons for functionality hints) and from drop-down menus under category headings.Using the Text EditorTo open the text editor, double click in a text field, or click the ‘Edit’ button in the toolbar.To start editing, just click in the editor and start typing! You can Copy and Paste text from external sources as required, format your text, or use drag-and-drop or the Insert menu to add files from the RSpace Gallery or from outside RSpace as attachments.The various editing capabilities in the Editor toolbars are identified with a tooltip on mouse-over, and some only become available when appropriate content is selected in the window.The menu items highlighted below access additional functionality from editor plugins which are presented in popup dialog windows: comments and internal links are described further in the sections below, while sketching and drawing chemical diagrams each have their own page.Comprehensive documentation on tables and their formatting can be found here.Line and paragraph breaksUsing the Enter (Return) key adds a paragraph break to text, while Shift + Enter adds a line-break to text:If your text looks double-spaced, it is possible that you've been using paragraph breaks where you've been meaning to use line breaks. Remembering to use Shift+Enter rather than simply Enter will fix this issue.SpellcheckerRSpace uses the default system spellchecker, which flags up words that might be misspelled by underlining them in red, and providing suggestions. In order to see suggestions, Ctrl + Right Click on the underlined word. Click on a suggestion to correct the word, or "Add to dictionary" to prevent this word from being flagged up in the future.If you do not see misspelled words underlined in red, please check your browser and operating system settings to make sure spell check is enabled.CommentsComments are additions to documents which allow a separate commentary about the document content which can be accessed from an icon – looking like a blue speech balloon –  in the text field. Any user with edit permission can add a comment, and the initial comment entered is the first in a thread which any edit-permitted user can open and contribute to.To add a new comment, you must be in edit mode with the editor open:Click on the speech-bubble icon in the bottom toolbar of the Text EditorEnter your comment, and click on Insert.The comment will appear at the current cursor position.To add to a current comment thread, double click on the comment icon in the text, either in view or edit mode, to open the dialog for that thread. Previous comments are listed in the dialog, with a box at the top to add your comment. Saving will add your comment to the conversation.Deleting a comment icon from text will delete the comment thread.MentionsMentions are a way of sending direct notifications to collaborators on a document through the Document Editor. To mention a person in a document, the document needs to be in the same share group or shared with the specific person you want to mention.To send someone a mention, enter the person’s name after the @ symbol. Pressing the @ symbol in the editor will prompt a dropdown menu with autocomplete for easier selection.When you click on the person's name, the mention appears in the document:Once you have mentioned someone and saved the document, that person will receive a notification in their RSpace messages providing them with a link to the document.You can also use the @ feature to instantly see a list of named individuals who have access to the document you are currently editing.Slash menuThe slash menu is a way of inserting various pieces of data into a document in an efficient manner, all from the keyboard. When inserting text, simply type a / (forward slash) and a menu of options will appear. Use the arrow keys to navigate or continue typing to filter the list and then press enter to select the item. To close the menu, either press escape or continue typing and the menu will close when there are no longer any matches.Copy and PasteCopy and pasting within and between RSpace documents, and from content outside of RSpace, is supported using standard keyboard commands (Control + V, Command + V). Copy and paste of text, numbers, images (e.g. from screenshots), and simple tabular data from outside of RSpace is fully supported.Your experience may vary when attempting to copy and paste more complex content from an external source. There is a lot of variation in the technical aspects of how different systems encode various data types in the clipboard, and how different browsers and devices support incoming clipboard data. Consequently it may not always be possible copy and paste some content from some sources.If you find that you are not able to paste certain sorts of images or complex content, we recommend dragging the source file or screenshot into your RSpace document instead.Internal LinksNext to Comments in the toolbar is a chain-like icon for adding links to other documents within RSpace.An Internal Link panel will open, as shown below. You can use Search to find a document to link, select it, then click on Insert on the bottom-right of the panel to insert it. You can also select Browse to browse the file tree instead: this file tree reflects your Workspace folder structure and lets you select any files or folders that reside there, including Gallery files or folders.To view a link once it’s created, right-click on the link and select Open Link. By clicking on the link, you can also choose which version of the document you want to link to: the current version, or a historical version.As of Version 1.52, you can easily copy-paste document IDs, creating links between documents within RSpace. Copy the ID like you would normally copy a piece of text, by right-clicking and selecting "copy". Here, an ID in document view is shown:Then paste it in a different document: a link will be created.Toolbar Configuration and Additional ActionsYou can configure the layout of the toolbar's items, as well as add or remove actions by clicking on File > Configure Toolbar:You can create new toolbar groups, add new rows to the toolbar, and reorder actions by drag-and-dropping the icons. You can also add or remove actions by using the "Unused actions" section, which will remove their icons from the toolbar; all actions remain accessible through the top-level menus. You can revert to the default toolbar configuration by clicking on "Reset to Default" on the bottom-right.Pagination and Print PreviewAdding content to a document is not constrained by what would fit on a defined page size such as US Letter or A4. You can add as much content horizontally as you like, and scrollbars will appear to let you view that content. However, in this case, when you save, a warning will show that such content may not be included in a PDF export. If you want to ensure that all content will be included in a PDF export, we recommend that you keep content to within the text area boundaries within the editor.Keyboard ShortcutsTo increase your productivity, RSpace allows for custom shortcuts to be set in the Document Editor. Just open a document and:Click on File in the text editorSelect ShortcutsYou can now set your own custom shortcuts as pictured below, following the instructions provided in the menu. Some shortcuts are already provided. Note the option to reset your current changes, and reset all keyboard shortcuts to default.You can also set shortcuts for symbols, by switching to the Symbols panel. Again, follow the provided instructions to do so.Save once you are done; the keyboard shortcuts will become immediately available to use.Note that the RSpace text editor allows you to edit a "Text Field". RSpace documents are made up of one or more Fields arranged in a sequence, and "Fields" can be either Text Fields or other types of Fields that you can choose from when you build "Forms" in the RSpace form building area. An RSpace "Basic Document" for example is made up of a single Text Field, but you can make your own forms that may contain any number of Fields arranged in a logical sequence. You can learn more about building Forms here.Inserting File attachmentsLearn about inserting files form the Gallery or from an external source here.How did we do?Related ArticlesSketchingInserting ImagesEgnyte Secure File-store Integration (for Enterprise)(opens in a new tab)Powered by HelpDocs(opens in a new tab)×ContactSend

Open the Sketcher either:from the Insert menu of the Text Editor, choosing Insert Sketch from the drop-downclick the Insert Sketch icon in the plug-ins segment of the bottom toolbar.A Sketch dialog window will open.Annotating an existing imageTo annotate an existing image located in an RSpace document (specifically an attachment within an RSpace text editor field):Click on the image in the Text Editor, so that it becomes highlighted and a sub-menu pops upIn that sub-menu, click on the Sketcher icon:Note that if you instead click the "info" icon, you can see information about the image including its file size and current location in the Gallery, as well as additional tools for downloading the image in order to edit it with your preferred external application:Features of the SketcherThe Sketcher window contains:On the left-side, a range of drawing tools.On the right-side, settings that can be applied to objects in the sketch – the options appear when an object is selected.Frequently used figures or fragments of sketches can be selected and saved in the saved sketches bar on the far right of the sketcher. To do this, select an object with the mouse tool (top-left in the sketch tool bar), and click Save selection (top right). This object can then be re-used in any other diagram or image annotation during the current editing session. To add previously created sketches, click the saved sketches button at the top right then click the sketch you want to use. Once you have added an image, you can adjust its size, proportions, location on the sketch canvas, and even the angle it is displayed at (using the "green G" angle adjuster). This can help you make additional space on the canvas for doing things like adding additional text annotations.You can also drop in existing images from the top level folder of your image Gallery. To do this, click the access Gallery button to see the Gallery bar and select an image from the list. Once you have added an image, you can adjust its size, proportions, location on the sketch canvas, and even the angle it is displayed at (using the "green G" angle adjuster). This can help you make additional space on the canvas for doing things like adding additional text annotations above, below or ajacent to the image. Once you have added an image from your Gallery, you can then also save it to the saved sketches area, making it faster and easier to find subsequently within the sketch tool.How did we do?Related ArticlesImage Annotation[Video] Insert a SketchTooltips(opens in a new tab)Powered by HelpDocs(opens in a new tab)×ContactSend

This allows for doing basic mathematical calculations on tabular data inside text fields.To insert a Calculations Table you must be in edit mode in a document text field. Click in the text field to create an insertion point for your file. Go to the editor toolbar above the text field, and find the ‘Insert Calculations Table’ button. This will open a window like the one in the screenshot below.Inside the ‘Calculations Table’ dialog you can edit the content of the table and also add/remove columns and rows (try right-click menu). When editing a table cell you can insert a plain value, or a formula. The formula has to start with an equals sign (=) and will be calculated after switching to another cell. Inside the formula you can reference another cell with $A1 or A1 syntax, similarly to Excel.When you finish editing the table click on ‘Insert’, and the table will be added to the text field. When the calculation table is added to the field it is treated as any other field element, and can be moved around or deleted. Double-click on the table (or use context menu action) to re-open it for editing.The list of supported operations includes:math functions: + - * / ^logical functions: = > < >= <= <> NOTtrigonometric functions: SIN, ASIN, etc.other formulas like: SUM, SQRT, LOG, ROUND, IF, AND, ORExamples of other formulae:=SUM(A1:C1)    -> add values from cells A1, B1, C1=ROUND(B1/C1, 2)  -> divide value of B2 and B3, round to two decimal places=SUMIF(A1:C1, ‘>1’) -> add A1, B1, C1 values that are larger than 1A longer list of available functions is available here.How did we do?Related ArticlesChangelog - what's new?[Video] Work with Tables in RSpaceUsing Science Tools(opens in a new tab)Powered by HelpDocs(opens in a new tab)×ContactSend

This is useful if you want to create a table of contents, or want to improve navigation by linking to relevant sections when you mention them in the text.Note that anchors do not work in Notebook view.Insert an anchorPlace your cursor where you want the anchor to be inserted. Note that anchors can't be placed on a totally empty line. There needs to be at least some text at that location.From the top menu, choose Insert > AnchorGive the anchor a name, and click SaveYou will see that your anchor has been added to the document as a bookmark iconNow, select a piece of text that you want to use to jump back to your anchor section. This can be anywhere in the same document.Click on Insert external link in the toolbarIf the page you are working on includes named anchors than the Anchors dropdown will automatically be included in the URL editor tool. In the Anchors dropdown, select the anchor you want to link to, then click on SaveThe text will change to a link. If you click on this link in view mode, you will jump to the location you placed the anchor at.It's also possible to copy the FULL URL for an anchor and page from your browser address bar, and use that in OTHER RSpace documents as a way to jump directly from one document to a specific LOCATION within a totally different document. A URL that contains and anchor ends with something like "#location" where "location" is the name of the anchor you created.How did we do?Related Articles[Video] Link External DocumentsPublished Documents and Unpublishing DocumentsPublication of Documents(opens in a new tab)Powered by HelpDocs(opens in a new tab)×ContactSend

It allows users to share, preserve, cite, explore and analyze research data while ensuring that the researchers, data authors, publishers, data distributors, and affiliated institutions all receive appropriate credit.If you have a Dataverse repository, it is now possible to directly export your files or data from RSpace to Dataverse. This allows you to make use of all Dataverses’ features while still using RSpace as your primary storage space for research related content.Configuring the Dataverse ApplicationThe Dataverse Application is quick and easy to configure within RSpace:Navigate to the Apps page within RSpace and click on the ‘Dataverse’ tile. A box will open below it as seen in the screenshotIf the Dataverse App is currently disabled, click the “Enable” button to enable itClick the “Add Dataverse” button to add your repository's informationIn the form that opens, fill in the three fields:The ‘Server URL’ field is the URL of the Dataverse instance (of the form https://xxxxxxx.dataverse.org)The ‘API Key’ field is the API key for a user who has permission to submit to this repository (a string of the form xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx). You can obtain your Dataverse API key from your Dataverse account settings.The ‘Dataverse name’ field is the identifier of the Dataverse repository. This is typically a single-word name that was entered when the Dataverse was created.Click ‘Save’To test the Dataverse connection, click the ‘Test’ button, if you have entered the information correctly a pop up notification should inform you it has succeededIf you wish to add additional Dataverse repositories simply repeat steps 3-6 above.Having trouble with getting the app to work? Check out the apps troubleshooting section.Exporting Content to DataverseExporting content from RSpace to Dataverse is very simple. In addition, as well as exporting the Document, RSpace also ensures it is tagged with relevant metadata, such as the author, contact and Orcid ID (if you have entered your Orcid ID on RSpace).From within the Workspace select the Document you wish to exportIn the menu bar that appears click the “Export” buttonA dialog appears. Select the desired export format and select the 'Export to a repository' option. Then click 'NEXT'Several options for the format of your export appear. Fill them out and click 'NEXT'Within the new window that opens select the Dataverse Repository you wish to export to (if you only have one Dataverse Repository configured, it will be selected by default)If you've got the DMPTool Integration enabled, you will be able to associate the export with a DMP, which will automatically add a link to the export in the "related works" section of the DMPEnter values into the fields listed:All the fields are requiredThere must be at least 1 author and 1 contact, others may be added using the “Add” buttonSelect the “publish status” of the Document (keeping it in “draft” status means the Document remains unpublished within Dataverse)Click “EXPORT”After a short delay two new notifications will appear:The first should inform you that the export has been generatedThe second should inform you that the deposit has succeeded and contain a link to the external Dataverse page corresponding to the depositIf you click on the link within the notification, it will take you to the Dataverse page corresponding to the deposit. Here you can see that metadata such as authors, contacts, title and description have been added along with the deposit. In addition, your Orcid ID will be present alongside your name if you have entered it into your profile within RSpace.How did we do?Related ArticlesDMPTool Integration[Video] Dataverse IntegrationFAQ(opens in a new tab)Powered by HelpDocs(opens in a new tab)×ContactSend

This integration aims to make research workflow as efficient as possible by enabling user to access contents of Protocols.io without leaving RSpace.Enabling Protocols.io IntegrationInformation for administrators on how to enable protocols.io for their RSpace instance is available at Setting up Protocols.io integration.Protocols.io is an open access repository for science methods. RSpace’s integration enables you to import protocols into RSpace that you can modify for your own experiments.To enable Protocols.io integration, go to the Apps page and enable the integration if it is not already enabled. Then click ‘Connect’ which will initiate the authorisation process, whereby you grant RSpace permission to access your Protocols.io resources:Having trouble with getting the app to work? Check out the apps troubleshooting section.Creating a new RSpace document from Protocols.ioOnce authorised, you can import protocols from the main ‘Create’ menu:By default you see a listing of your own private protocols. You can search these or re-order them to help find your protocol:You can also see all public protocols as well:You can search for protocols too. If you want to search for something that has more than word, enclose it in double quotes, e.g. "Targeted in-situ genome wide" will search for an exact match. Without the quotes, every word is searched for individually.Once you’ve chosen one or more protocols to import, click ‘Import’. RSpace will then retrieve the protocol and create a new document in RSpace containing the protocol steps, in the ‘Imports’ folder.Here is an example of an imported protocol. It is now a regular RSpace document that can be edited or shared with your group.You can also browse protocols from within the text editor by clicking on the protocols.io toolbar button:After choosing to importing a protocol, the same import process happens, but in addition, a link to the imported protocol is made in your notebook entry:Some protocols may contain images. RSpace will try to import these images as well. These will be placed in a folder in the Image Gallery.How did we do?Related ArticlesSetting up Protocols.io integration[Video] Protocols.io IntegrationIntroduction to configuring RSpace Apps(opens in a new tab)Powered by HelpDocs(opens in a new tab)×ContactSend

Slack is an online team-collaboration and messaging app tremendously popular with tech companies. It allows users to create teams (e.g. your lab group) which they may invite others (e.g. your lab members) to join. Channels can then be set up to discuss different topics (e.g. one for the grant application due, one to discuss interesting papers etc) and team members may message the group as a whole or individuals within the group directly. Slack also integrates with many other organisational apps currently used: Doodle, Skype, Trello, Google Calendar and many, many more.To find out more about the exciting capabilities of Slack, check out its user guides hereEnabling SlackAs of version 1.37 RSpace offers integration with Slack. This allows RSpace users to post links to RSpace documents directly into Slack channels or private messages sent over Slack.Before using the RSpace integration with Slack, it must first be enabled by your Sysadmin. Once that is done follow these steps to enable Slack within your app directory and begin communications with your RSpace team via Slack.Click on the ‘Apps’ tab in RSpace to open the ‘Apps’ pageClick on the ‘Slack’ box to enable itA dialogue box will open below the app buttonsIf the box informs you Slack is currently disabled click the ‘Enable’ buttonClick the ‘Add to Slack’ buttonHaving trouble with getting the app to work? Check out the apps troubleshooting section.Adding Slack channels to RSpaceYou can send messages to Slack directly from RSpace document editor, but first you need to authorize RSpace to post to your Slack channels.To do that log into RSpace, click on ‘Apps’ tab and select ‘Slack’ app. You’ll see all the channels that RSpace can send messages to. To register more channels, click on ‘Add to Slack’ button.Clicking on ‘Add to Slack’ button will open new window, where you can select a channel from your team’s channel list (you may need to log into Slack first). Select a channel you want to post to, and click on ‘Authorize’.The authorization window will close, and you’ll be back on ‘Apps’ page, with a dialog asking you to label your new channel, and save it in RSpace.Pick up a unique label that’ll let you identify the channel in RSpace drop-downs (you can change it later). Click on ‘Save’.. Your newly added channel will be listed in your Slack app details.Posting a Document to Slack from RSpaceGo to the workspace and select the RSpace document you wish to link to from SlackClick on the Slack button that appears in the top right corner of the document frameSelect the Slack channel you wish to post the document to from the drop down listEnter a message to post alongside the document if you wishClick ‘Send’A direct link to the document in RSpace will appear in the chosen Slack channel, along with any message you included, as shown below.You can also, since 1.46, post messages with links to multiple documents from the Workspace:Select some documents (perhaps from a Search)Click on the ‘Send to Slack’ button to get a popup in which to put your message.Slack to RSpace Slash Commands InteractionAs of version 1.49, RSpace has begun integrating slash command functionality for interacting from Slack with your notebooks. Thus far, RSpace has the following slash commands available to use live:RS-SearchIntroduced in version 1.49, RS-Search allows users to perform a search in RSpace and show the results in Slack. This as well as being useful in its own right also serves as a Hudson Bay Start for more complex interactions.To search RSpace from Slack, follow the next steps:If you haven’t done it yet, go to RSpace Apps page, enable Slack App, and use ‘Add to Slack’ button to register at least one channel. This will add RSpace Slash Commands to your Slack input box.In the Slack input message box type /rs-search help. This command will issue a prompt that describes how to use the /rs-search command.Note: if you configured your Slack App before RSpace 1.49, you may need to re-register your team’s channel on RSpace Apps tab to see the commands.As an example, let’s assume Adrian has created a Getting Started notebook that he wants to share over Slack. By simply typing /rs-search Getting Started in Slack, he links a copy of the notebook that will redirect anyone clicking on it to the copy on the RSpace website.How did we do?Related ArticlesChat[Video] Slack Integration for RSpaceDryad Integration(opens in a new tab)Powered by HelpDocs(opens in a new tab)×ContactSend

Operations on ChemDraw files work in the same way as for other chemistry file formats: instructions for enabling and using this feature are included in the sections below.OverviewRSpace uses ChemAxon MarvinJS structure editor for chemical structure drawing and display.You can use MarvinJS to draw chemical structures and reactions, and import from or export to standard formats such as ChemDraw, mol, SMILES, etc. MarvinJS supports 3D rotation of structures and sophisticated structure search.The full documentation for this service can be found here. The following is a quick-start guide about how to start using the Chemistry editor in RSpace.Note on Drawing Chemical Structures in WordIt is not possible to draw chemical structures in Word without using an external plugin, such as JChem or Chem4Word. We recommend drawing the structures in the RSpace document editor instead, using our ChemAxon integration, as this will make them easily searchable within RSpace.Enabling ChemAxon IntegrationFirst of all, make sure that the Chemistry feature is enabled. Go to the Apps tab and enable Chemistry:Having trouble with getting the app to work? Check out the apps troubleshooting section.Importing Chemical Structures by drag & dropIf you have a file, or multiple files containing chemical structures saved in a standard format (e.g. ChemDraw, mol, SMILES), you can drag & drop them to text editor to have them imported as a chemical drawings.Drag & drop import feature was added in RSpace 1.63. If you're using an older version, you can still import chemistry file through Marvin plugin, as described in 'Drawing Chemical Structures' section.Just open the document for editing, then select chemical files from your computer's desktop and start dragging them into the text field editor. The drop area will show up:Dropping chemical files into the import file area will convert them into Marvin format and draw them as chemical structures in the document. It will also save a copy of the file to a separate 'Chemistry' section in the gallery:Chemical Structure that appears as a result of dragging and dropping a chemical file into the editorUploaded Chemical File in the new 'Chemistry' Gallery sectionChemistry files uploaded via dragging and dropping into the editor, or by uploading them to the gallery and inserting them into a document have different properties to those created and inserted via the Marvin sketcher tool:Chemical structures created by upload of a chemical file can only be viewed in the Marvin Sketcher tool and cannot not edited.Chemical structures created in the Marvin Sketcher tool can be edited. You can upload and edit chemical structures from your computer this way.Drawing Chemical StructuresTo draw a chemical structure start editing a text field, then click on the benzene ring icon in the Text Editor toolbar, or clicking ‘Insert’ > ‘Structural formula’.A ChemAxon Marvin sketcher tool will appear. You can draw molecules and reactions out of combinations of elements, or you can import a file containing a structure in common format such as mol or ChemDraw (use the 'Import' button in the top toolbar).After drawing or importing a structure insert it to your RSpace document, where an image of it will be placed in the text where the cursor was placed when opening the editor. To edit an existing chemical structure, select it in the document, then click on the benzene-ring icon to open the editor again. The structure remains fully editable at all times.Properties of a Chemical StructureRSpace displays metadata on chemical structures and reactions, both in view mode and edit mode.When you select a chemical structure when editing (by clicking on it), a column appears on the right-hand side of the editor pane, with a series of cards displaying the metadata of each selected chemical structure. Each card has small thumbnail of the structure to help distinguish multiple structure cards apart. If you prefer to use the full expanse of the editor pane, you can hide these cards easily by clicking on "Close all".Chemical StructuresChemical Reaction (shows chemical metadata for each reactant and product)After saving the document, the chemical element will have its basic properties calculated and displayed next to it. You can also click on the image to see larger preview of the molecule or reaction, or click on the download icon to download a PNG image of the structure.Exporting structuresUsing Marvin Sketcher you can also export structures in various standard formats - use the ‘Export’ button in the Marvin Sketcher toolbar.Searching for Chemical StructuresChemical structures, or elements used in them, can be searched for using ChemAxon’s structure search feature. The search mechanism is located in the drop-down options of the main Workspace search, at the top right of the Workspace view.There are various types of chemical search, the default is substructure search. ChemAxon’s documentation gives full information about the characteristics of each search type. When you open the Chemical Search dialog, draw the structure (whole or part) query, then click Search:Documents and chemistry files stored in the gallery that contain chemical search hits are listed, together with an image of the search hit. You can click on the document link to open it, or the gallery link to see the chemical file in the gallery. The screenshot below shows some example search results.Uploading New Versions of Chemical FilesChemical structures that have been uploaded through drag and drop into the editor or directly to the Gallery have a file associated with them. This file is stored in a separate Chemistry section in the Gallery. From the Gallery or a document, a new version of this chemical file can be uploaded, replacing any structures present in the system with the new one. This workflow is shown below, where we upload a chemical file called caffeine.mol, then upload a new version called amphetamine.mol using "Upload new version"; we can see that after the update, the chemical is noted as being on Version 2 in the info panel.How did we do?Related ArticlesFAQDryad IntegrationZenodo Integration(opens in a new tab)Powered by HelpDocs(opens in a new tab)×ContactSend

This integration enables you to browse and filter PyRAT, and to import records from PyRAT as tables into your RSpace notebook.There is some initial, one-time setup required. Permission must be obtained from Scionics, the makers of Pyrat. supportATscionics.com. They will issue a client ID. This client ID, and the URL of the Pyrat instance must then be set on RSpace server deployment.properties file. Either Research Space can perform this, or an on-premises RSpace administrator. Details of the properties are in the RSpaceConfiguration.md configuration document included with RSpace distribution.ConfigurationGetting set up is quick and easy. In order to use PyRAT, make sure an administrator has configured RSpace to use PyRAT and has set it as 'Available' in the System->Configuration panel.1. You will need a personal access token, which you can request from your PyRAT admin:2. Now, in RSpace, go to Apps Page and enter your key, enable the App, and save. After you've saved, the App panel should look like this:You can update your token at any time by entering a new value and clicking 'update'.Using PyRAT from RSpaceYou can access PyRAT from the text editor toolbar.Clicking the button opens a paginated listing of entries (some columns are redacted for privacy):You can filter results and also choose which columns to display:To insert data into RSpace, select the desired rows using the checkboxes, then 'Insert'. A table will be added to RSpace text field with the visible columns.TroubleshootingCORSIf you see an error message relating to CORS or pagination label that looks like thisthen your PyRAT server has not be adequately configured for integration with RSpace. We make a cross-origin request directly from the RSpace application to the PyRAT server and as such the PyRAT server must allow cross-origin requests. Furthermore, it must also allow us to access the custom HTTP headers that describe the number of results in the search query. It is for this reason we recommend that the PyRAT server be configured to respond with the HTTP header of:access-control-expose-headers: *Thereafter, RSpace will be able to access the x-total-count header and display the results with pagination.How did we do?Related ArticlesRSpace Inventory Hub 🧪Changelog - what's new?Dryad Integration(opens in a new tab)Powered by HelpDocs(opens in a new tab)×ContactSend

Contact support if your local Omero uses some other authentication mechanism and you are interested in connecting with RSpace.For pilot RSpace servers we automatically connect RSpace to the demonstration Omero server at https://demo.openmicroscopy.org/. If you want to try the Omero integration, you will need to create your own account on that omero server, then enter the details in the Omero panel of the RSpace Apps tab. To connect RSpace to a different Omero server, contact RSpace support.Testing the integration with your data on Demos server:Sign up for an account on the RSpace demos server: https://demos.researchspace.com This will allow you to use our demo Omero Integration with data on the Omero demo server in Dundee (https://demo.openmicroscopy.org). You will also need to create an account on that Omero server. See the 'Getting Started' section for what to do next in RSpace after you have created that account.Testing the integration with your data on your local RSpace:Your RSpace admin has to enable the Omero Integration from the 'system' -> 'configuration' -> 'system settings' page and then configure it to connect to your local Omero Service by setting the correct values in RSpace properties (a restart of RSpace will then be required). RSpace admins must configure two properties:omero.api.url=omero.servername=Omero.api.url should be the url of your Omero server. Omero.servername can be used as 'omero'. Enable Omero from the Apps page (as show below) and enter your Omero username and password: the Omero Integration will now display data from your local Omero account.Getting startedEnable Omero on the RSpace Apps page and enter your username/password for your account on the Omero demo server. Click 'connect'. You will be taken to a page with a success message. You will stay logged in to Omero until such time as you log out of RSpace.An Omero icon will now be visible in the texteditor for RSpace documents:The Omero Integration will display data from your Omero account.Navigating the data in the integrationFirst chose to edit a document that has a text field in it and click on the 'Omero' icon in the text editor. The following screen will appear:Your images will not be shown initially. The data represents a hierachy, with 'Projects' and 'Screens' at the top level. 'Projects' contain 'datasets' which contain 'images'. The 'children' of Projects and Screens are not displayed until you click on a 'show ...' link. See the screenshot below for how this works.'Screens' contain 'plates' which contain 'plate acquisitions' which contain 'images'. Plate Acquisitions may contain multiple 'sample fields'. Each field links to its own grid of image data.Clicking on the 'show...' links will fetch the next level of data and finally display a grid of images. The grid of images corresponds to the wells in a plate acquisition if you are drilling down from a screen; for a Project the grid is just a convenient representation of the individual images.It is also possible to navigate from low level data back to its parent. Images will have links to their Plate Acquisition, these will link back to Plates and Plates link back to their Screen. The same applies to Projects with Datasets etc.It is possible to 'hide' child data - this will hide all children and their children etc. Subsequent clicks on 'show children' will then reveal child data and any previously displayed children of that data etc.Click on 'see in omero' to see the original data on the omero server.Clicking on any item in the grid of images will fetch details of that image and draw a larger thumbnail of the image.The new thumbnail and its detailed data will be added as 'children' of the Plate Acquisition (or dataset). As such they can be hidden via the 'hide children' link of their parent. They can also be selected for insertion into an RSpace document.Fetching additional detailsThere is sometimes additional information about the data which can be fetched by clicking on an item's 'fetch details' link. The new data will be displayed on the right, in the 'description' column. If there was no additional data, nothing will be displayed.Viewing extra large thumbnailsSmall thumbnails are displayed in the grid of images for a dataset/plate acquisition. When you click on one of these thumbnails, a larger thumbnail along with full image details is added as a child of the dataset/plate acquisition. You may chose to fetch an extra large thumbnail. Click on the 'large thumbnail' checkbox below the image and then on the 're-draw image' link which appears.You will now see an extra large thumbnail (see below). If this is inserted into RSpace, vieiwing alongside its description data will require sideways scrolling. You can click on re-draw image again to return to the smaller thumbnail.Inserting data into RSpaceClick on the checkbox to the left of any row of data and it will be inserted into RSpace when you next click the 'Insert' button. Clicking on the checkbox at the top left of the page will select ALL data on the page. Entire grids of images are not insertable into RSpace. However, if you chose to 'hide' the grid of images, its associated dataset or plate acquisition will be insertable.Filtering data on the screenYou can choose to see both Projects and Screens or only Projects or only Screens using the radio selections at the top of the page. You can also choose to filter the data displayed on the screen. Enter text into 'Filter Results' then hit 'return' - only matching rows of data will now be displayed.Sorting dataData may be sorted by clicking on the table header at the top of the page - click on either 'path' or 'description'. Sorting is alphabetic.How did we do?Related ArticlesRSpace Inventory Hub 🧪Dryad IntegrationZenodo Integration(opens in a new tab)Powered by HelpDocs(opens in a new tab)×ContactSend

Contact support if you wish to use this integration, otherwise it will not connect to Clustermarket. There is a one-time setup procedure needed in order to activate this integration.Clustermarket is an all-in-one lab management tool for scientists to get more research done. This integration enables you to view (and insert) your bookings from Clustermarket as tables into your RSpace notebook. The data stored in RSpace will have links back to Clustermarket.ConfigurationIn order to use Clustermarket, make sure an administrator has configured RSpace to use Clustermarket and has set it as 'Available' in the System->Configuration panel. Clustermarket must have also authorised the Integration with your Insititution's RSpace, as per the note above.1. In RSpace, go to Apps Page, click on the 'Clustermarket' app, enable the App and then click 'Connect'.2. You will now see the Clustermarket authentication page. You will need to have already created an account with Clustermarket.After connecting you will see the 'disconnect' button on the apps page which shows you have succesfully connected.Authorising labs in ClustermarketRSpace is only allowed to view the bookings from labs in Clustermarket which you have authorised. To give RSpace permission to view bookings from labs in Clustermarket:1. Go to https://app.clustermarket.com/oauth/authorized_applicationsIf RSpace<Your Institution> is connected, you will see the disconnect button as show above. Press 'disconnect' and then 'connect'. You will see:Choose the labs you wish to authorise, the selected labs' bookings will now be visible in RSpace. Unselected labs will not show their bookings in RSpace. You need to repeat this process if you create any new labs.ReconnectingYour authorisation to connect to Clustermarket will expire periodically. When this happens you will see the following when you attempt to use the integration in RSpace:If this happens, go to the Apps page and 'connect' to Clustermarket again. You may not have to re-enter your credentials with Clustermarket, in that case you will see the 'disconnect' button on the apps page which shows you have succesfully connected.Using Clustermarket from RSpaceUsing an equipment form.A generic equipment form has been added to RSpace for capturing additional Equipment data. Go to 'Manage forms' in the MyRSpace tab and choose 'all' forms. The new form is called 'RSpace_Equipment_Form'.Select the form and choose 'add to menu', you will now be able to choose this form when you choose the 'create' -> 'from form' option in the workspace.The form is intended to capture experimental details about the useage of the Equipment. Its use is entirely optional, the Clustermarket data will insert into any RSpace document:You can access Clustermarket from the text editor toolbar.Clicking the button opens a table with details of your bookings and the equipment used. The table is sortable by any of the column headers. By default it will show your most imminent bookings at the top.The 'Booked' choice shows upcoming bookings whereas 'Booked and Completed' shows completed bookings as well. The 'Booked Equipment' choice shows Equipment that has been booked along with data on the most recent completed booking.BookingIDs and Equipment Names are hyperlinks to Clustermarket - click on either to see the appropriate page in Clustermarket.The 'maintenance only' checkbox will only display maintenance bookings. An extra column is shown in the data, 'maintenance notes'. This shows the data from the first maintenance note added to that booking. Subsequent maintenance notes added to the booking are not shown.The following image shows the 'Equipment' Choice with 'maintenance view' also selected. Since Equipment view only shows the last completed booking, two of the rows of equipment data have no booking data as there was no completed maintenance booking.To insert data into RSpace, select the desired rows using the checkboxes on the left of the table, then click the 'Insert' button at the bottom right. A table will be added to RSpace text field with the visible columns. The data in the table is editable. A 'notes' column is inserted into the table, this is intended to allow you to insert your own notes about the bookings.The hyperlinks to Clustermarket do not work while the table is in 'edit' mode. Click on the save icon, this inserts the data into your document and the hyperlinks to Clustermarket will now work. The table is no longer editable until you chose to edit the document again.How did we do?Related ArticlesChangelog - what's new?Dryad IntegrationZenodo Integration(opens in a new tab)Powered by HelpDocs(opens in a new tab)×ContactSend

In addition, if RSpace and Nextcloud are installed in different domains, your Nextcloud instance has to allow Cross Origin Requests (CORS) from the RSpace domain.Configure OAuth on Nextcloud:You (or the Nextcloud Admin) will need to set up RSpace as an OAuth client in Nextcloud, this will display a clientID and clientSecret for you/RSpace staff to copy into the deployment properties for the relevant RSpace install.1) As Nextcloud Admin go to the nextcloud security section.2) Add a new Oauth2 client, for redirection url use <Rspace host>/nextcloud/redirect_uri3) Click 'Add'. Nextcloud generates a clientID and clientSecret for you to copy.Configure Cross Origin Requests (CORS) on Nextcloud:One solution is to install the 'WebAppPassword' app and then enter the RSpace domain as an allowed domain, after that all CORS issues are removed.https://gitlab.tugraz.at/dbp/nextcloud/webapppasswordWebAppPassword is available in the nextcloud App store and install is a simple few clicks. Go to 'Admin' profile (on right of screen) and click on that and then click on 'Apps' to get to the App store for Nextcloud.WebAppPassword is found in the security section of the Apps page:Once installed, go to 'Admin' -> Settings -> 'WebAppPassword' is shown on the left of the screen under the 'Administration' section. Enter your RSpace host under 'allowed origins' and click on the 'set origins' button.Configuration of your RSpace serverThis step should be done by RSpace server administrator1) Edit your RSpace deployment.properties in /etc/rspace and add the following at the bottomnextcloud.client.id=[ID FROM NEXTCLOUD]nextcloud.secret=[SECRET FROM NECTCLOUD]nextcloud.url=[YOUR NEXTCLOUD URL]nextcloud.server.name=[DISPLAY LABEL, e.g. My NextCloud]nextcloud.auth.type=oauth2) Restart tomcat on your RSpace serverAllowing the use of NextcloudThis step should be done by RSpace user with System Admin roleThe Integration is disabled by default, an RSpace sysadmin must enable this Integration by the usual mechanism on the 'system'-> 'configuration' -> 'system settings' page. The property is called 'nextcloud.available'.Using Nextcloud in RSpaceConnecting to Nextcloud:Every user of the Integration must log into Nextcloud using their Nextcloud credentials to obtain an OAuth token to be used by RSpace. This is performed by going to the 'Apps' page in RSpace, 'Enabling' the Integration and then clicking on the 'connect' button.You will be taken to a Nextcloud login page:If you have not configured your RSpace instance as an OAuth client for Nextcloud (see above), you will instead see the following:Once authenticated with Nextcloud you will be redirected back to RSpace and you can close the Apps page and open your workspace.When editing a document, you will now see a 'Nextcloud' icon in the toolbar. (If there is no Nextcloud icon you may have forgotten to enable the Integration, which you have to do as well as connecting to Nextcloud).Clicking on the Nextcloud icon opens a file chooser with your Nextcloud documents visible:Finally, saving the document leaves links to any chosen Nextcloud files embedded in the document.Clicking on a link opens Nextcloud in a new browser tab. If the file can be rendered in the browser, it will be opened. For example, linking to 'Nextcloud Manual.pdf' will open with your browser's built in pdf viewer. Nextcloud can occasionally hang while attempting to render a file in the browser. If this happens, press 'cancel'. If the file cannot be rendered in the browser (or you pressed 'cancel' while Nextcloud attempted to render the file), Nextcloud will open the directory containing the file, scroll to the file and highlight it. Nextcloud may also download the file. You can find examples of files that might not open in your Nextcloud 'Templates' directory.

We are keen to get feedback/suggestions for ways to enhance and extend this integration: contact us at support@researchspace.com!In RSpace 1.71, we have created a prototype integration with DMPTool to enable researchers to reference and update their Data Management Plans (DMPs) from within RSpace. The aims of this integration are:To add value to DMPs so that they link to datasets generated over the course of a study and become 'living documents' .Reduce the burden on researchers in keeping their DMPs up to date.Append DOIs and links to datasets exported from RSpace to a repository (e.g Dataverse, Figshare, Dryad) to be associated with a DMP.Before startingCurrently we integrate with DMPTool. In order to connect your DMP to your RSpace account you'll need an account on DMPTool.If you want to be able to update DMPs with references to datasets exported to a repository, you'll need an account on Figshare, Dataverse or Dryad as well, and have these connected to RSpace. See Dataverse Integration or Figshare Integration for details.Currently the integration is not installed by default. Please ask us if you want it enabled on your RSpace server and we will do this.Connecting to DMPToolThe first step is a one-time process to connect RSpace to your DMP account.In RSpace, go to the Apps page, choose DMP App, 'enable' it and click 'Connect'.If you are already logged into DMPTool in another browser tab, the page will just refresh. If you are not logged in, you will be invited to login and grant RSpace access to view your DMPs:After authorising, at the end of this stage, RSpace will have stored internally an API token with which it can retrieve your DMPs.You can check this by viewing the App again - if it has connected, there will now be text confirming this.Importing DMPs into RSpaceNavigate to the Gallery and click on 'Import'. You will now see an option to import a DMP.Click on 'Import DMP' button. You can browse both private and public DMPs.Public DMPs cannot be imported yet.Choose a DMP and click 'Import'. If successful, a PDF copy of the DMP will be added to RSpace.View this imported DMP in the DMP section of the Gallery.As with any other Gallery file, you can link to it in RSpace documents, include it in exports etc.Updating DMPs with DOIs or links to data depositsHere, we will make a deposit of an RSpace export to a repository such as Dataverse, Figshare or Dryad, and update our DMP automatically.Before starting ensure that you have connected RSpace to your repository account. See Dataverse Integration or Figshare Integration for details.Choose some work in RSpace to exportChoose to make an HTML or XML export, and choose to export to a repositoryIn the next screen, choose to update a DMP and select the DMP you want to update. Note that only the DMPs you have imported into RSpace will be visible.Proceed with the export as normal.Note that at the "configure export" stage you can also add industry standard tags pulled from ontology sources such as bioportal, and these will be added to corresponding metadata fields in the destination repository.After you have received two notifications (firstly, that the export succeeded, secondly that deposit to repository succeeded), check your DMP account. Your DMP should have a link to the deposited data included as a dataset in the 'Other works associated with this research project' section of the DMP:Future workWe plan to enhance this integration over time, including:Supporting other DMP management tools as well as DMPToolEnabling DMP plans imported in RSpace to update automatically when the DMP is updated in DMPToolGenerating formal DOIs to the exported work.How did we do?Related ArticlesFigshare IntegrationDataverse IntegrationDryad Integration(opens in a new tab)Powered by HelpDocs(opens in a new tab)×ContactSend

This document explains how to import DMPs from Argos and into RSpace and how to reference them consistently across documents.Before startingEnsure that your RSpace server has Argos enabled and configured. This will require a system administrator to follow the steps described in: Introduction to configuring RSpace AppsEnable the Argos integration in the Apps page, just as you would for any other third-party integration. See Apps IntroductionImporting DMPs into RSpaceNavigate to the Gallery and click on 'Import'. You will now see an option to import a DMP.Tapping the menu item will open the dialog for browsing and choosing a DMP.Unlike DMPTool, all DMPs in Argos are public so there are no controls for toggling access levels. Instead there are a few other controls for finding the right DMP.SearchingArgos has strong search capabilities and we support the ability to search for DMP by its label, grant, funder, and collaborators.PaginatingEven after searching, there are likely to be lots of results. To view more than the first few, use the controls in the bottom right corner. Here, you can view more of the DMPs at once or move to subsequent pages.Customisable ColumnJust like in Inventory, the column with gear icon can be modified to display different attributes of the DMPs. If you're looking for a particular DMP this may also help in finding it.If there are any other ways in which we could make it easier to find DMPs, please don't hesitate to reach out to support@researchspace.com.Completing the importOnce you've found the right DMP, select it using the radio button in the leftmost column and then press the "Import" button.On completed, the dialog can then be closed.If you now go to the Gallery's DMP tab, you will be able to see all of the DMPs that you've previously imported, including this new one.Referencing the DMP in a documentAs with all Gallery items, it is very simple to reference the file in an RSpace document. By doing so, all of the documents reference the same file and it thus becomes possible to quickly see all of such documents in one place.Open or create any document with a freeform text fieldChoose Insert > From RSpace Gallery, then from the DMP tab choose your DMP.Save the documentFor more information on including files from the Gallery into documents, see the documentation on inserting images from the Gallery into an RSpace document as the process is much the same for DMPs.To view all of the documents that make reference to the DMP, tap the DMPs little info icon, then choose "Show linked docs". This will display a table of all of the documents that reference this DMP.How did we do?Related ArticlesDryad IntegrationZenodo IntegrationOmero Integration(opens in a new tab)Powered by HelpDocs(opens in a new tab)×ContactSend

In addition, iRODS has an extensive plugin architecture that includes authentication, databases, and a powerful API.RSpace provides methods to connect to an iRODS (ICAT) instance, and files are accessed and linked to in the same way as other file systems.SetupSystem Administrators will want to follow Configuring Institutional File Systems, specifically the section on iRODS File System Specific Options.Users will want to follow File Store Integration (for Enterprise) to connect and log in to their iRODS instance.UsageOne of the benefits of using an iRODS instance to link to files within RSpace is that you no longer have to worry about your links getting broken if files are moved around on the file system. Files are retrieved using their unique DATA_IDs instead of their file paths within iRODS so you'll always be able to get a hold of your files reliably. Links are created in the same way for files in iRODS as they are for other file systems, therefore the generic File Store Integration (for Enterprise) instructions can be used.How did we do?Related ArticlesConfiguring Institutional File SystemsChangelog - what's new?Dryad Integration(opens in a new tab)Powered by HelpDocs(opens in a new tab)×ContactSend

Choose the Export option in the sub-menu to bring up the Export dialog.Select an export format, then click on Next. There are different options to configure dependent on the type of export file format you choose – see Export Formats for further information about export file types and how to choose between them. You may also see options to export your data directly to a supported third party repository such as Dataverse and to include files that appear in your document as links, but which are located outside of RSpace in supported external file stores.The next screen allows you to specify details of your exports; it will depend on the format chosen (Export Formats). As an example, a .ZIP HTML bundle has been chosen. Click Export to confirm.You will get a notification that your export request has been received. When the export is ready, you will be notified. Click on the notification icon to access it.If you've chosen HTML or XML as a format, the export notification will contain a link that will trigger a download of the exported files when clicked. If you've chosen PDF or DOC as a format, the notification will contain a link to the Exports section of the Gallery tab. You can download the export by selecting its checkbox, and clicking on 'Download' in the side-panel (as displayed below).HTML/XML:PDF/DOC:Exporting a selection of your work from the GalleryFrom 1.47, you can export items and folders from the Gallery as well as the Workspace. The process is similar to that of exporting a selection of your work from the Workspace; the only difference is that you have to select the documents through the Gallery tab.Exporting all of your workIf you want to export all of the work you have produced, go to My RSpace:Then click on the right arrow until you can see the Export-Import button and click it:In the resulting page, click on Export all my work and choose the format (more information in Export Formats). If you choose HTML or XML, all of your documents, notebooks and attachments will be included in the export. Exporting also preserves external links with their source paths, and, for PDF exports, a footer table is generated with details of the full path for each included link.See Migrating Data from Community or Test Server to Enterprise if your goal is to transfer your data to a different RSpace instance.It's also possible to export data programatically using the RSpace API.

Export Options provides a step-by-step guide on how to export documents.The available formats are each suited to a particular intended use of the exported files:an ELN archive (a zip file containing XML), which supports the interoperable ELN archive format. a Zip file containing HTML is the ideal choice if you are wanting to view, edit and otherwise work with your content outside of RSpacea Zip file containing XML is best suited to content which is likely to be exported to a repository or archive, re-imported back into your RSpace instance or transferred between RSpace instances (see Importing Content into RSpace)a PDF is ideal to compile together work in a viewable but non-editable filea DOC (MS Word) file allows for exported documents to be easily editable within WordFurther configuration options complete the export process and the resulting files are made available to download or store.ELN ArchiveAn ELN archive (a zip file containing XML).This is identical to a zip file with XML contents but also contains an ro-crate-metadata.json file, meaning this export supports the ELN file format (.eln) and its file format specification.PDFOne or more documents or folders can be exported as a PDF, and you can configure the way the pages and sections of the PDF are constructed. The PDF format is familiar and easy to access, but does not unclude attached data files.To export as PDF, select one or more documents or folders, then click ‘Export’, and choose the PDF format (check out Export Options for a detailed guide).You can configure your PDF contents in the export dialog, and can optionally choose a name for your PDF export.When multiple documents are selected for export they are conveniently collated together into one single PDF, and a footer table is generated with details of the full path for each included link.Depending on your region, you may want to switch the paper size from A4 to "letter" RSpace will remember your choice and use that as the default subsequently.After submitting the export request, RSpace will schedule the export and notify you when it’s ready. In the notification, there is a link to the 'Exports' section of the 'Gallery' tab, from which you view the PDF by clicking on the thumbnail, or download it by selecting its checkbox and clicking on 'Download' in the side-menu that appears.HTMLHTML makes a self-contained, text-based export of content, for easy access and sharing with collaborators, archiving or even, possibly, future editing outside of RSpace. All attached files are included in their original format, the data is organised and linked exactly as it was in RSpace, and the bundle is browsable with any web browser.To export as HTML, select one or more documents or folders, then click ‘Export’, and choose the HTML format (check out Export Options for a detailed guide).You can choose whether you want to include linked documents in the export, and to what depth (whether the documents linked to by those additional documents should also be included).After submitting the export request, RSpace schedules the export and notifies you when it’s ready. In the notification, there is a link to download the HTML export as a zip file.Download and extract the zip archive, and then open the file ‘index.html’ See below) in your browser to see a main table of content page. You can now navigate your exported content offline.XMLThe XML format best suited for export of data cohorts destined for future re-import back into another RSpace server or account (e.g., when a student is graduating and moving to a different university), or for export to a long-term repository or archive that requires or prefers data to be in the the XML format. XML may also be good choice if you want to import data into a third-party system that specifically supports ingestion of XML.To export as XML, select one or more documents or folders, then click ‘Export’, and choose the XML format (check out Export Options for a detailed guide).You can choose whether you want to include linked documents in the export, and to what depth (whether the documents linked to by those additional documents should also be included).You can optionally include the entire revision history of the documents to export.After submitting the export request, RSpace will schedule the export and notify you when it’s ready. In the notification, there is a link to download the XML export as a zip file.After downloading and extracting the zip archive, you can inspect the contents – these will be in a computer-readable XML format.DOCThis format is especially useful if you would like to edit the content of an RSpace document offline, outside of RSpace, then return the edited file back to RSpace later. MS Word exporting is detailed in Exporting to Word. Note that Word export is only available if you select an individual document.How did we do?Related ArticlesExport OptionsArchiving and ExportExporting a LabGroup’s Work(opens in a new tab)Powered by HelpDocs(opens in a new tab)×ContactSend

After completing the Export dialog, the resulting file is made available to download or store. Export Options provides a step-by-step guide on how to export documents and how to export all of your work, while Export Formats describes the various export formats.To summarise:XML or HTML files are available temporarily for download, via a link sent to the user in an RSpace notification. Respond promptly to this notification and click the link it contains to download your export file, as the link will become inactive after a period of time.PDF and .DOC files are added to the Exports section of the Gallery, and from there can be used in documents (and therefore shared with other RSpace users), viewed as single read-only documents, sent to file repositories or become available – like all other Gallery PDFs/.DOCs – for publishing and distribution.Publishing PDFs & .DOC exportsThis guide assumes you've already generated a PDF/.DOC to publish. For a step-by-step guide on how to generate PDF/.DOC documents from RSpace files, check out Export Options.To choose to make Gallery PDFs or MS .DOC files public and share content with people who are not RSpace users:Navigate to the GallerySelect the Exports Gallery Select the checkbox a of PDF/.DOC you wish to publish, then click Publish in the Gallery menu.This will produce a stable download link that you can copy and share with other users, who do not need to be authenticated.Import of archives back into RSpaceYou can import XML zip achives that were previously exported from RSpace, which will add all documents as new documents into RSpace.

These might include existing shared laboratory documents (protocols, SOPs), shared data files and personal protocol files/notes.You might also want to reimport RSpace data that was exported as an XML archive (see Migrating Data from Community/Team/Test Server to Team/Enterprise), for example in the case where a lab relocates to a different institution and wants to transfer their data to the new RSpace instance.Import options include :From Microsoft Word documentsFrom Plain text documentsFrom RSpace XML exportsImport from EvernoteFrom Protocols.ioUsing the RSpace API (which can be used for custom bulk import from another ELN-- just get in touch!)Below are options for importing content that will be turned into native RSpace documents. You can also import data into the Gallery, where the files are stored in their original state (see The Gallery).Importing MS Word and plain text files as RSpace documentsIn order for ‘Import from Word’ to work, your RSpace admin must install an app on the server, the RSpace Aspose App. If import from Word seems broken, please check with your RSpace admin if it has been installed.In the Workspace, click on Create, then on From WordUse Browse to select Word, Open Office, or plain text files to import. RSpace will attempt to import any file that can be recognised as plain text, regardless of file type.Your documents will go into the current folder by default. You can optionally choose a folder or notebook where you'd like the new documents to go by clicking on choose a folder or notebook, and clicking on Home to navigate your Workspace.Click on Import. Each file will create a separate RSpace document, named after the file.Any images embedded in the Word documents will be extracted, and added to the Image Gallery. The original file won’t be added to the Gallery automatically. You can add the originals yourself (see "Uploading to the Gallery" in The Gallery).Importing RSpace XML archivesTo import an XML archive:First, obtain an XML archive of the data to import (see Export Options & Export Formats).Navigate to My RSpace > Export/Import (you will have to use the right arrow to view the option)There are two options now. If you have downloaded an export to a local file on your computer, and want to import it to RSpace, this is option 1 'Personal import'.Alternatively, if you are part of a managed migration where an export has been migrated from a trial server to an on-premises server, this is option 2 ' managed import'.Option 1 - 'personal import' : Browse to the export archive file on your local machine.Option 2 - 'managed import': You will see an addition input area:Enter the path to your export that is located on the server. You will be provided with this path by the RSpace migration team.3. Click on Import.A report will be generated, summarising what documents were imported, what global IDs were assigned to them, and any errors encountered.The current behaviour is that:All the data in the archive is imported into the Workspace of the user performing the import, and they become the document owner.Documents are imported as ‘new’ documents and will not overwrite existing data.Sharing information is lost on import, so documents need to be reshared on import.Groups and user accounts are not automatically generated (since you might be importing into an installation that does not have those groups or users).See Migrating Data from Community/Team/Test Server to Team/Enterprise for more details.Importing legacy data from third party ELN systemsIn some cases it may be possible to re-structure third party XML data to make it compatible with the  RSpace XML import feature, OR use the RSpace API, OR  use some combination of both these featues to ingest legacy data that has been exported from third party ELN systems. ResearchSpace has experience importing substantial quantities of legacy data from a number of different third party ELN systems. In most cases this requires some engineering effort by ResearchSpace, so additional fees may apply on a time and materials basis.

This is a straightforward process.You can use this same process any time you need to migrate data. Example scenarios include:Migrate a copy of your data from Community/Team/Test Server to Team/Enterprise/Community after the end of a trial or pilot.Migrate data from one RSpace user account to another, either on the same server or a different server.If you lose access to a paid server when you leave an organization but want to migrate a copy of your data to the free Community Edition server so that you can continue to use RSpace.Each user that wants to migrate their data will have to:Export all their data from the old server as an XML archive and download the .ZIP file using the link in the notifications area (see Exporting all of your work in Export options). Import the XML archive (i.e. the single .ZIP file) into their account on the new server (see Importing RSpace XML archives in Importing Content)Some browsers and operating systems may automatically extract downloaded archives for user convenience. Please ensure that during data migration (Export -> Import) the file selected for import is an archive file and you're not trying to import the extracted archive folderPlease note that:Groups and sharing will need to be set up again (see LabGroups, Sharing Content)The user performing the import will automatically be assigned as the owner of the imported documentsWhen importing into an RSpace version < 1.69.50, the document creation timestamps will be replaced by the import creation time. Since 1.69.50, the original creation timestamps are preserved. Furthermore, the original creator will be shown in the imported document's Info Panel:Some document duplicaton might occur, if eg. a sharer and a sharee both import a shared document. You will need to delete copy and ensure that links to the deleted copy are updatedThe original revision history and audit information are not preserved. If you wish to preserve a record of the original revision history, make an XML Archive to include the Revision History, and keep it, as it contains all of this metadata. You can also ask us to send you a copy of the audit logs or database dumps of the old server.The destination server needs to be the same version as the source server or newer. If you see an error alerting you to a version problem, contact your IT team to request an update of the source server, then perform the export - import process again.If the importing .ZIP file exceeds the maximum upload file size setting on the destination server, the import will fail, and you will need to contact your RSpace System Admin to get them to temporarily increase the maximum import size to accomodate the size of your .ZIP file.Digital signatures are NOT supported by this migration method. Digital signatures are only valid within the context of the secure RSpace server where they were created, although SHA256 protected versions of individual signed documents CAN be downloaded and stored outside RSpace if necessary. To protect an entire bundle of exported work, consider using a third party tool to digitally sign the exported .ZIP bundle.PIs can Export a LabGroup’s Work, but note that this will make the PI the owner of all the documents when the data is imported back into the new server. Only use this option if you do not care about preserving the ownership information, but wish to easily migrate all the work done.If you have been using the free Community for evaluation purposes and you want to prevent users from accidentally continuing to log into the Community server after the migration has occured, you can email support@researchspace.com to request that we disable the OLD account on Community server so that users will only be able to log into their new account on your new server.How did we do?Related ArticlesRSpace new license server - May 2021Sharing Data with non-RSpace Users[Video] Chemistry Data Sheets in RSpace(opens in a new tab)Powered by HelpDocs(opens in a new tab)×ContactSend

RSpace provides several ways of reusing elements of work you have done:Templates and Snippets take portions of existing documents and store them as starting points for making new documentsForms define a reusable structure for a document (with no content in the structure), and that structure is used each time a new document is made based on the form. You can create a template from a form-based document to have both a reusable document structure (from the Form), and reusable content (from the Template).If you are new to RSpace and have been tasked with building workflows for your organization, the overall process typically looks like this:Create a Form made up of fields arranged in a sequence. Each field corresponds to a step, an event, or data / metadata that needs to be collected.Use the Form to create an empty RSpace document.Locate your new document in your Workspace, verify that the fields meet your needs. If necessary, add exemplar content, or additional instructions to the fields. For example, if the workflow will be used to create a sequence of replicate experiments, many of the initial steps may be the same for each replicate, so you can save time by entering default values in some of the fields.Save the document as a Template.To distribute the Template to others, locate the Template in your Workspace > Templates area and share as needed with groups or individuals with either read or edit permission.(Optional) You can use the RSpace digital signature feature to sign the Template to prevent further changes and show that the Template has been approved by one or more lab mates.In general, we recommend that you use Templates rather than Forms to distribute approved workflows to groups and individuals. Most of the time, a Form is merely an intermediate step.TemplatesTemplates are reusable documents that can be used to generate new content quickly and easily when some elements do not change. Templates are made from an existing document, allowing a choice of what to keep from the original.Creating TemplatesFrom a DocumentThe quickest way to create a template is from a simple document. In this case you don’t have the option of the different field formats (e.g. dates, multi-choice options) a form offers, but it takes less time.To create a Template from a document:Find the document in the Workspace and open itClick the Save as Template buttonA dialogue box will appear asking you to name the Template and which fields you wish to include content from (for a simple document there will only be one field, ‘Data’). Click OKYour Template will now appear in the Templates folder in your Workspace.From a FormTemplates may also be created from documents with multiple fields and field types using Forms.To create a template from a Form, you must first save the Form as a document. Open the document created from a form in RSpace.At this stage, you may fill the fields of your form-based document that will remain the same between experiments.Select ‘Save as Template’You can give your Template a name. In the ‘Include contents from these fields’ section, select the boxes of the fields you have filled in, which will remain constant throughout the experiments (Protocol in this example), and leave fields which vary with each experiment unticked (Notes and Concentration in this example), then click OK.Your Template will now appear in the ‘Templates’ section of your Workspace.Creating a Document from a TemplateIn the Workspace, select Create, then From TemplateSearch and select the template you want to use, give the new document a name, and click on CreateYou will be redirected to your newly created document. You can edit the fields and save as you would normally in a document.How did we do?Related Articles[Video] Work with TemplatesUse Default Sample Templates 🧪Create and Use Sample Templates 🧪(opens in a new tab)Powered by HelpDocs(opens in a new tab)×ContactSend

Snippets are reusable fragments of content that can be stored in the Gallery and reused in future documents.Saving a SnippetWhen editing a text field you can select some of its content and click on the ‘Snip’ icon in the editor toolbar to create a snippet. This opens a dialog where you can name and preview the snippet. Selected content may contain HTML elements such as tables, images or text. After clicking ‘OK’, the snippet gets added to the Snippet Gallery.Using a SnippetOnce in the Gallery, Snippets can be organised and manipulated as any other Gallery files. Click on a selected snippet to preview it.To insert a snippet into a document click on ‘Insert > From Gallery’ in the text editor menu. When the Gallery dialog pops up, navigate to the Snippet Gallery (click the ‘scissors’ icon on the left side menu), select a snippet, and click ‘Insert’.To aid in searching and sharing snippets, RSpace assigns each snippet a unique global ID with the format STXXXXX. Links to snippets using the global ID will open the Snippet in the Snippet Gallery.Sharing snippetsSnippets can be shared with individuals or groups. The snippets folder in the Gallery now contains a SNIPPETS_shared folder. This contains 3 subfolders for lab group shares, collaboration group shares and individual shares.Shared snippets appear in a sharee's appropriate SNIPPETS_shared sub-folder.Shared snippets can be seen in My RSpace -> Shared Documents tab and 'unshared' from there.How did we do?Related Articles[Video] Create a Snippet in RSpaceAPI Swagger DocumentationInventory API Introduction 🧪(opens in a new tab)Powered by HelpDocs(opens in a new tab)×ContactSend

This shows the contents of one folder at a time. The folder you initially see on first login is your Home folder, which is at the top of your folder hierarchy.You can create any number of sub-folders within your Home folder and navigate through the hierarchy by entering folders or returning back up the path you have taken: click in folders to enter them or go back by selecting clickable points on the breadcrumb trail which displays under the toolbar as you navigate.Another view mode / option for List View is the View All mode, which can be accessed by clicking on the folder icon on the toolbar, and selecting View All.This view shows a flat listing of all content that you have permission to see, ordered by modification date (most recently modified first). This view is useful in several situations:– you’re frequently modifying a document that is buried deep in your folder structure.– you’re a PI wanting to see what your group members are recently working on.– you’ve modified something fairly recently and can’t remember the name of it to search for.– you want to see both recently edited files you own and recently edited files that are shared with you.Besides List View, you can switch to another view mode called Tree View by clicking on the list icon on the toolbar, and selecting Tree View. This view will persist to be selected until you click on the list icon again, and select List view from the drop-down menu.Tree View gives a classic parent/child expandable view of all files and folders of both the Workspace and the Gallery:Clicking on folders will open or close them in the tree, clicking on documents will open them for viewing or editing them as usual, and clicking on gallery items will download them to your local computer.FiltersFilters show a restricted view of content – i.e. they limit the amount of documents you see. You can toggle the filters on and off by clicking them, with an ‘on’ filter displayed on a blue background.‘Favourites’ filter –  by marking a document, notebook or folder as a Favourite, you can click the Favourites button to show only these marked items. This is useful if, for example– you’re frequently working on the same document or notebook.– you’re a PI and want  shortcuts to your group members’ home folders in the Shared/LabGroups folder.You can add or remove documents from Favourites using the options which display when selecting their checkbox, so it’s easy to change your Favourites as you work on different documents over time.Favourites are displayed in the Workspace with a star icon:‘Shared with me’ filter – this shows documents that have been explicitly shared with you by other people. This is, in effect, a flat listing of all documents that you can see from you LabGroup, Collaboration Group or Individual Shared Item folders, ordered by modification date (most recently modified first). This is useful when– you want to see other people’s documents rather than your own.– you’re working on a collaborative project with many people contributing documents.‘My Lab Group’ filter – is a shortcut button to the groups you belong to. If you’re a PI, you will also see the Home folders of your lab group’s members in this view.‘Templates’ filter – this shows all of your templates in 1 long list, without folder organization.Workspace Views and Filters work globally on all of your content. So, if you navigate through the folder view to a sub-folder, then click on a filter, you will see the filter applied to all of your work, not just those items in the sub-folder.Filters and SearchWhen you perform a search, the filters are taken into account in the search, and further restrict the search. So, for example, if you search for ‘protein’, and you have enabled both the ‘Shared with me’ and the ‘Favorites’ filter, then the search will just return documents containing the word ‘protein’ that have been shared with you, and that you have marked as a Favorite. You can broaden the search by disabling a filter and re-running  the search.How did we do?Related Articles[Video] Use Workspace Filters in RSpaceToggle Inventory and Container Views 🧪View and Search the Audit Trail(opens in a new tab)Powered by HelpDocs(opens in a new tab)×ContactSend

Only the document creator is able to edit the caption field. They may write anything they like, though the primary purpose of captions are to aid in locating files at a later date.For example, say you had multiple series of experiments and wanted to quickly search for a particular one; you could save a caption of “Enzyme Assay Series1 Exp1”. Then a search for “series1” would return that file (and any other files in series1 you had captioned).Captions are edited from the information window present for each file. To open the information window click on the blue ‘File Info Button’ next to the file name. Then click on the “captions” field and write the desired captions into the text box.Captions may only be edited by the owner of the document.How did we do?Related ArticlesThe GalleryInline viewing of Word, Excel, Powerpoint and OpenOffice filesFile Info Button(opens in a new tab)Powered by HelpDocs(opens in a new tab)×ContactSend

These revision entries are added in the revisions table, which users can access to find details of changes made, with choices to view the revision and to restore the version if required (see sections below).Regular autosaves, which occur while you work, do not immediately create new revision points. The changes are saved to the revision history when you save or close the document. The current changes can also be reverted by closing the document without saving, or by using the "Undo" button of the text editor.See the revision history of a documentClick the checkbox next to the desired document in the WorkspaceSelect Revisions from the sub-menu that appearsA page appears showing the history of the document:The page contains:The name and version number of the documentID links that link to specific versions of the document (read "Linking to fixed revisions of documents" below)Modified by and Modification Date columnsThe Modifications Details column shows what actions were performed or what fields were edited in the revision – this can become quite an extensive list if many actions were performed in one editing session before saving, but it allows precise location of activities without needing to repeatedly view the documentClickable links at the end of each row to View or Restore the documentLinking to fixed revisions of documentsYou can make links to fixed revisions of RSpace documents, in order to link to a snapshot of the whole experimental context at a point-in-time – including fixed versions of attachments, and linked documents.First, you will need copy the ID to the specific revision of a document. To find a fixed revision link for a document:Access the revision history of a document (the previous section, "See the revision history of a document", explains how to achieve that). In the revision history view, the ID column contains stable links to specific revisions.Alternatively, if you are already viewing a revision, you can get the link  to the unique ID from the top right-hand corner of the document view:Copy the link, by right-clicking and choosing Copy Link Location (this might be phrased differently based on the browser you are using).If you paste this link into a document (Control + V or Command + V), you will create a formatted link that links to a fixed revision, with a logo of a clock going backwards in the icon. In comparison, a live link to a document will have a green arrow in the icon.The document IDs will look like SD623658v2 , where SD623658 is the document number, and v2 is the version number, which makes the version numbers easily readable from the document ID (in the following example, v4 and live version since there is no version).Any exports you make of the document that links to the fixed version will include the fixed version as well, not the live version.DeletionsDeleted documents only get marked as "deleted" and do not actually get deleted from the database, and so can always be restored.If you are the owner of a document, deletion will remove it from the view of all users with whom the document is shared, as well as from your own view.If you delete a document that has been shared with you, it will only be deleted from your view; the original owner and any other users with whom the document is shared will still be able to see it.Deleting an ItemYou can delete an item in the Workspace by selecting its checkbox and clicking Delete in the secondary toolbar:Or clicking on the Delete icon when viewing the document:Restoring Deleted ItemsDeleted items can always be restored in RSpace. To restore an item that has been deleted:Click on My RSpaceClick on Deleted ItemsThere you will see a list of all deleted items, and filter by name in the top-right searchbar. The rightmost column, Options, shows what actions can be taken: click either View (for documents) or Restore the item in question.

These documents can be edited manually, or populated using CSV files imported using the My RSpace > Export-Import page.3)Tags can also be selected from external industry standard ontologies such as https://bioportal.bioontology.org/ connected to RSpace via the RSpace API.When adding tags, the system will make suggestions after you have typed a few characters:PIs can decide to enforce the use of ontologies within their lab group, this will remove the option to enter tags as free text and enforce that all sources of controlled vocabularies for tags be in ontology files shared with a Group, or, if allowed, from an external ontology. This is described in detail below.General use of tagsYou can add tags to any document you can edit – just click on the 'edit' symbol and add them as a comma-separated list in the ‘Tags’ textbox at the top-right-hand side of the document view. Current tags are displayed in this location.Clicking on 'edit tags' displays a text input which will be autopopulated with 'suggestions'. It will also display existing tags as tag 'pill's. Click on a pill to see information about that tag and or click on the 'x' in the pill to delete the tag.Tag pills which have meta-data (ie they come from an Ontology) are displayed with a dark blue background. Tag pills for 'free-text' tags are displayed with a light blue background.When searching for a document that has a given tag, RSpace autopopulates the possible search terms from existing tags. Searching for tags is a very powerful way to organise and aggregate your research documents in multiple ways – for example by grant number, project, or publication, or simply as a collective name for a related or themed set of documents. To view only a selection of documents marked with a particular tag, choose ‘Tag’ in the Workspace search drop-down and enter the identifying term you have tagged a series of entries or documents with – the search returns a table of results which only shows items containing the particular tag. Tagging documents makes them easier to find and collects them in search results with similarly tagged related content.Stop words and TaggingThere are various words that the search engine will not find. These are generally short prepositions such as 'of', 'and', 'this', 'that' etc. The search engine will not be able to find tags that are solely comprised of these stop words. It will, however, find tags that include these stop words but are not exclusively using stop words. Therefore it will not find a document tagged with the value: 'of'. It will find a document tagged with 'Ides of March'.When creating a new tag RSpace suggests autopopulated values from existing tags AND from any ontology files in your workspace or shared with you (see below).You may use free text instead. Simply click in the textbox for tags in order to see the suggestions. Tags can be created as key=value - just enter the tag as 'key=value' (no surrounding quotes are required) using freetext or in an ontology file (see below). Searches for a tag with 'key=value1' will return only documents tagged with 'key=value1' and not documents tagged with 'key=value2' etc. When ontologies are enforced, RSpace will only allow tag values from ontology files shared with a group you belong to. If you type in the tag text box this is used to filter the autopopulated suggestions. Suggestions are in alphabetical order. RSpace will only display up to 1000 suggestions, when there are more possible values than 1000, RSpace will display an initial value of'============CLICK_HERE_FOR_NEXT_DATA============'.Click on this value in the suggestions dropdown to load the next 1000 suggestions. When there is no more suggested data, RSpace will display:'================BACK_TO_START================'Click on this value in the suggestions dropdown to cycle back to the original suggestions.When there are too many possible values, RSpace requires you to narrow them down by entering some text and will display: 'Too many results, please enter a specific search term'.Whenever you save (or delete) a tag, RSpace creates/updates a file inside an 'Ontologies' folder in your workspace with an icon respresenting its purpose:This file is an example of a controlled vocabulary/ontology file. Do not edit this file by hand as it will be overwritten on any future saving of your tags.Forbidden characters in tagsThe following characters are forbidden in tags and will be rejected if entered as free text or from a tag suggestion term: '<', '>', '\'. A forward slash '/' is allowed from a suggestion but will be forbidden if entered as free text.Controlled vocabularies/ontologiesNote - as described above, you have an autogenerated ontology file created for you whenever you save/delete a tag in any document. (The file does not exist until you save/delete a tag). You may want to share or export this file, allowing other users access to the controlled vocabulary which you have created as document tags.You may create ontology files for the purpose of ensuring an agreed set of terms are used for tags. Although referred to as ontologies/controlled vocabularies throughout this documentation, these files are really just a controlled vocabulary as they have no concept of nested terms or hierarchies. However they do contain the ability to create key=value pairs which could be useful for eg namespacing.To create an ontology file:Click create -> From Form -> RSpace Tags from OntologiesThe generated ontology file contains 20 fields, each called 'Ontologies for Tag creation'.This file is just a normal RSpace file but it will be used to generate tag 'suggestions' following some simple rules as follows:Ontology terms should be comma separated. There can be one key per line of text, separated by an '=' from the values it matches.For example, I create a controlled vocabulary to describe experiments so I edit 'Ontologies for Tag creation' and enter : "started,finished,phase1,phase2". Whenever I chose to tag a document, these 4 values will appear as 4 separate suggested terms for the new tag. If I wished to namespace this, then I would enter: "experiment_stage=started,finished,phase1,phase2". Whenever I chose to tag a document I will now have 4 separate suggested key=value pairs for the tag. These will be 'experiment_stage=started', 'experiment_stage=finished' etc.There can only be one key per line of text, therefore in order to create further key=value pairs you must enter values on a seperate line in the file:After saving the ontology document, whenever I create a new tag for any document I will see the following suggestions:Viewing ontology filesIt can be useful to see all ontology files you own or are shared with you. There is an 'ontologies' view in the workspace:This shows your ontology files and ontology files shared with you. Note that if ontologies are enforced, only those files which have been shared with a Group will be making any contribution to the controlled vocabulary you can use to create new tags. (Clicking on the info, 'i', button for a file will show you whether it has been shared with a Group).Uploading ontology files in csv formatExternal ontologies can now be used in RSpace - for example https://bioportal.bioontology.org/ allows download of ontologies in the required CSV format.If an external ontology file is available in CSV format, it can now be uploaded to RSpace. Go to the export-import page under the My RSpace tab and choose a file using the dialog under 'Import an ontology file - csv format'.All inputs on the form are mandatory.You must choose a single column that will be used as terms for the controlled vocabulary. You must also choose a column which contains URIs to identify the ontology term. For example, having downloaded the 'BRENDA Tissue and Enzyme Source Ontology' from https://bioportal.bioontology.org/ontologies/BTO in CSV form, I decide to use the 'preferred label' column, which is column 2 in the CSV file (starting numbering at 1, not 0). I enter 2 under 'Identify column which holds data'. URIs are contained in column '1' so I enter 1 under 'Identify column which holds URIs for data).Note that you may optionally import an Ontology which consists of only a single column of ontology term values. In that case, enter '1' for both fields.After a succesful upload, RSpace will open the workspace, showing the new file. The ontology terms will all be on one 'line', with up to 10,000 terms per 'Ontologies for Tag creation' field in the document. There are 20 fields in the document, which means an uploaded CSV file can contain at most, 200000 ontology terms.If the upload of csv ontologies creates a large number of suggested ontology terms when creating new tags, RSpace will require you to filter the suggested tags options by typing a value into the tags text box.External ontology files may not be uploaded on the RSpace Community server.Troubleshooting: If your .csv file fails to import, or imports but does not seem to create a corresponding RSpace ontology Document, check the .csv carefully for extra commas or other hidden content that may have been introduced, especially if the file has been edited or created with an application such as MS Excel or Open Office.You can copy/paste small amounts of data into an existing RSpace ontology file rather than doing a CSV upload, so why use the CSV method? The CSV upload method is useful because 1) you can build, edit or acquire the CSV outside of RSpace and also 2) because if you attempt to paste more than a few hundred lines of text, you will likely cause your browser to freeze or crash.Viewing Tag source MetadataOntology terms from imported CSV files and external ontologies can show associated metadata so that their source can be determined. For imported CSV files this includes the name and version you gave the upload as well as the associated URI for the term. Metadata is displayed in tag suggestions:If the ontology file had only a single column of data, URIs will be displayed as 'NONE'Ontology terms from freetext or from your own manually created ontology documents does not have any meta data displayed in suggestions:Metadata is also displayed when you click on a tag 'pill'.Whenever tag info is displayed with meta-data the URI for the tag is copied to the clipboard.Tag info popups will be dismissed by subsequent clicks anywhere on the screen. Opening the tag info popup above would copy the tag URI - "http://evs.nci.nih.gov/ftp1/NDF-RT/NDF-RT.owl#N0000011307" to the clipboard. You can use this to search for the URI in your browser.Metadata is also saved to your autogenerated ontology file whenever you add a tag to a document. It is also saved to the tagged document itself. Therefore metadata associated with a tag saved to a document will not be lost should the ontology file that tag came from be deleted/unshared etc.Sharing ontologiesOntology files can be shared as with any RSpace document. Recipients will be able to use them to create tags based on those ontology documents. You can share RSpace ontologies with LabGroups, Collaboration Groups and Project groups, and the owner can choose to share with either read or edit access. This allows for tremendous flexibility and helps groups of users categorize work in similar and consistent ways.When sharing an RSpace ontology document it must be shared into a shared FOLDER not a notebook. Only ontology documents shared into folders will be usable by the destination group.You may export an ontology file as an RSpace archive. Any recipient can then re-import it (i.e. as an RSpace archive, not as a CSV file).Enforcing ontologiesIn order to guarantee all group members use a shared vocabulary for tagging, a Lab Group PI now has the option to enforce ontologies on the My LabGroups page:If ontologies are enforced the following applies to all members of the Lab Group/ Collaboration Group (including the PI):New Tags cannot be entered as free text.New Tag suggestions will not be autopopulated from existing tag values.New Tag suggestions will only be autopopulated from ontology files which have been shared with a Group.As a user, if any group I am a member of has 'enforce ontologies' turned on, then these rules take affect in my workspace. This includes collaboration groups.Some examples:I am group PI and I turn on Enforce Ontologies. No ontology files have been shared with any group I belong to. I will not be able to create any new tags until an ontology file is shared with a group I belong to.I am group PI and I belong to a collaboration group. Another PI in the collaboration group turns on 'enforce ontologies' for the collaboration group. No ontology files have been shared with any group I belong to. I will not be able to create any new tags until an ontology file is shared with a group I belong to.I am a member of a group with enforced ontologies and I wish to use my own ontology file to create tags. I share it with the PI. I will not be able to use the ontology file to create tags and neither will the PI. I must share the file with a Group before I, or any member of the group, may use the file to create tags.BioPortal OntologiesYou can use data from the BioPortal Ontologies site as a source of tag suggestions.Whetzel PL, Noy NF, Shah NH, Alexander PR, Nyulas C, Tudorache T, Musen MA. BioPortal: enhanced functionality via new Web services from the National Center for Biomedical Ontology to access and use ontologies in software applications. Nucleic Acids Res. 2011 Jul;39(Web Server issue):W541-5. Epub 2011 Jun 14.Group PIs can chose to allow "BioPortal Ontologies" on the MyLabGroups page. By default this is not allowed.Group members, including PIs, can only use BioPortal Ontologies if ALL groups to which they belong have allowed use.Once allowed, data from BioPortal Ontologies will be shown among your own Ontologies as tag suggestions.When creating new tags, you must enter a search term of > 2 characters long before the BioPortal Ontologies data will be queried and shown among your tag suggestions.Tip - use a discriminative term when searching, there can be many results returned otherwise.Tags in InventoryTags in Inventory support all of the functionality described above: imported controlled vocabularies, metadata, and the BioPortal. The interface is slightly different, but behaves much the same.Adding tagsWhen creating a new item (a container, a sample, etc) or when editing an existing record you can tap "Add Tag" in the Tags section under Details, and the tag selection box will appear.Here, you will see the same set of suggestions as when tagging documents in the ELN. Tags imported from controlled vocabularies -- be they imported CSV files or the BioPortal -- will have metadata about their version and ontological name. Once saved, you can view this metadata by tapping on the little blue icon.You are also free to enter any tag you like provided it is at least 2 characters in length, and does not contain any of the forbidden characters described above.Searching for TagsThere are two ways to search for Inventory items that have a particular tag.The first is you can search for it by typing into the "Tags" search parameter using the same menu as when adding tags.The second is to tap a Tag wherever they appear on the page, which will perform a search as if you had chosen the tag in the search menu.Do note that performing a seach for tags will trigger a Lucene query which allows for the tag search to be combined with a search for other parameters. For example, you could search for all the records that have a particular tag and are owned by you.How did we do?Related ArticlesPublished Documents and Unpublishing DocumentsSelect Items in Inventory 🧪Basic and Structured Documents(opens in a new tab)Powered by HelpDocs(opens in a new tab)×ContactSend

These resources are uploaded to the Gallery once, but can be linked to many times in your documents once in the Gallery. The Gallery is also a repository for re-usable content you create, such as Templates and Snippets.Accessing the GalleryThe Gallery can be accessed in two ways:from the Gallery tab, for importing and organising files:from the Import from RSpace Gallery button in the Text Editor toolbar when editing a document, in order to place files into a document:Gallery sub-divisions for different file typesFiles placed in the Gallery are organised by file-type into separate sections named Galleries, which are accessed either from the Choose Gallery drop-down menu, or from the quick-access icons down the left side of the Gallery display. The Image Gallery is displayed by default. The central box in the display shows the contents of the currently selected Gallery, shown as file type icons.In RSpace Enterprise, Gallery has an additional tab that enables registration of a file store, allowing links to these resources to be made in RSpace documents. To learn more, read File Store Integration (for Enterprise)File Info panelThe right side of the display is for further information about selected files, and allows for downloading, uploading a new version, and showing linked documents. The panel is loaded when you click the Get Info icon above the file name:The File Info panel also allows searchable captions to be added to the resource, just click on Captions in the panel to add a caption:These captions can also be edited from links to Gallery items made in Notebook entries. Note that only the owner of the attachment can add or edit captions.FilteringYou can filter the files displayed in the Gallery by use of the search bar. This accepts any name or part-name, so you can filter by file suffix, such as ‘doc’. You can also fiter using the RSpace unique identifier for a file if you know it. Note that if a specific item you are searching for is not showing, that you might be in the wrong file-type Gallery.What is more, media can be sorted by name/data using the Order by dropdown.PreviewingClicking on an image file will allow you to navigate images more easily using the arrows, and zoom-in/fullscreen the view.Depending on your browser / OS setup, videos can either be played in view or edit mode of a document, or downloaded to your machine for playing locally.Office/Open Office, plain text and Markdown (from 1.77) documents can be previewed in the Gallery pane by clicking on them. The preview supports navigation through an entire document/ spreadsheet /slideshow.Uploading directly to the GalleryContent can be uploaded to the Gallery from your computer or mobile device using the Import button in the Gallery toolbar. Imported files will be sorted by type to the appropriate Gallery (see Gallery Sorting Rules below). Some servers may also be configured to import files directly to the Gallery from certain approved third party sources (e.g., DMPTool).One or more files can also be added via drag-and-drop directly into the main Gallery display area. The files will be placed in a suitable sub-section of the Gallery based on the file extension.If it does not seem like an item was uploaded, make sure that you have checked the appropriate Gallery: eg. if you're viewing the Exports Gallery, and upload a PNG image, the image will only be placed and visible from the Image Gallery.Uploading directly to a DocumentAttachments or media that are inserted directly into a document (via the Insert file from computer icon, inserting from a file repository such as Dropbox, or by drag and drop) will immediately appear in the document, and will also be added to the Gallery in the appropriate tab for their file type (see Gallery Sorting Rules below), and be available for use in other documents.Gallery Sorting RulesWhen uploading files to the Gallery or directly to a Document, the files will be sorted into the appropriate Gallery folder based on their file extension. The table below summarises which file types get sorted into which Gallery folder.Gallery FolderFile typeImagepng, jpg, jpeg, gif, bmp, tif, tiffDocumentdoc, docx, rtf, pdf, odt, ods, odp, txt, ppt, pptx, xls, xlsx, csv, pps, mdAudio (access through "Choose Gallery" menu)mp3, wav, wma, aac, oggVideomp4, mov, hdmov, m4v, wmv, avi, mpg, mpeg, flv, 3gpMiscellaneousEverything elseOperating on Gallery itemsSelecting a checkbox for one or more media files reveals a menu with operations such as rename, copy, delete, export (see Export Options) and edit for images (see Editing Images). These work in a similar way to the operations in the Workspace.Deletion of media from the Gallery does not remove it  from the database, so existing documents that link to the media can still access that media. Deletion merely hides a media file, preventing its subsequent use.Organising the GalleryFolders can be created to organise media content, and media can be moved between folders by drag-and-drop.When you click on a folder, a breadcrumb link will be displayed. You can click on the blue links to navigate back up the folder structure. You can also click the parent folder to leave the current folder, or drag-and-drop an item onto the parent folder to move it outside of the folder.Determining which files have been used in which RSpace DocumentsYou can increase efficiency and avoid adding redundant copies of the same file to RSpace by using a single Gallery file in any number of RSpace documents. RSpace helps traceability by tracking which files have been used in which RSpace documents. To see how a file has been used, click on "Show linked docs" in the info panel on the right. RSpace displays a list of linked identifiers that you can click on to visit documents that include that file.How did we do?Related Articles[Video] Search the Gallery in RSpace[Video] Use the Gallery in RSpace[Video] Manage Gallery Files(opens in a new tab)Powered by HelpDocs(opens in a new tab)×ContactSend

You can add any file or digital object in any format from any source to your documents using drag and drop or insert > from computer (or device). Attachments added to documents are added automatically to the gallery and thus, become available for use in your other documents. Attachments are links to the attached resource. This helps with efficiency and traceability as you do not have to upload multiple copies of the same file to RSpace in order to use it in different documents / experiments / workflows. You only neeed to add a file once, then subsequently you can use insert > from Gallery to add the SAME file to any number of additional documents. RSpace tracks which files have been used in which documents. You can see that information in info > Show linked documnts.Inserting file attachments from the GalleryYou can add files directly to your Gallery at any time using drag and drop or the Import button. Files are automatically placed in one of several separate sub-gallery areas according to their file type. There are areas for images, multimedia files, documents (MS office, text, PDF etc), chemical structures and miscellaneous file types. There is also a gallery section for storing PDFs and MS Word files exported from RSpace. You can view and organize gallery files hierachically, and perform various actions on them.Files from the Gallery can be inserted into an RSpace document as an attachment by clicking the ‘Insert’ menu and and selecting ‘From Gallery’ from the dropdown. You can also type a forward slash / to get immediate access to the "insert using keyboard" popup.Inserting attachments from your computer or device.Files from your computer or device can be added to any RSpace document text editor editor field in edit mode. They will appear in the text of the document and will ALSO be added to the appropriate section of the Gallery. Attachments can be inserted by drag-and-drop from another open window on your computer, or by one of the options in the ‘Insert’ menu, or you can type a forward slash / to get immediate access to the "insert using keyboard" popup.In the image below you can see a gel image dragged from a Mac finder window to the text editing field of an RSpace basic document. Click the "info" icon to see more information abou the image including:• The RSpace ID of the file in the format GL*****• The location in the Gallery where you can find the image you just added.• A list of all RSpace Documents where that image appears (just one in this case)• Other metadata related to the file you just added.Viewing attachmentsAttachments appear in the document as a bordered block containing an icon and a list of actions. ‘Download’ action allows viewing of the document by downloading from RSpace (to the local computer running the current viewing browser) and opening in any available appropriate application. ‘Info’ action gives information about the file in RSpace.Many common file types including images, documents and chemistry structures can be viewed inside RSpace. For a list, see Supported File Types. RSpace can generate a PDF preview for many attachment types, for example MS Word files. If the attachment can be previewed you’ll see a magnifying glass icon displayed on top left of the attachment block, and a ‘View’ action on the actions list. Clicking on magnifying glass expands a preview and displays attachment information.Clicking on ‘View’ opens a new tab (make sure your pop-up blocker allows it) with PDF version of the attached document. This way you can, for example, read MS Word files attached to RSpace documents without having MS Office package installed on your computer. Remember that ‘View’ action shows you the PDF version of the attachment, you need to use ‘Download’ action to get attached file in the original format.After saving, any attachments now referenced by the document are now in the flow of the text, and are also listed at the foot of the page.Clicking the ‘i’ button next to an attachment shows some basic properties of the file  creation date, size, etc. You can add captions from within this information panel. Captions are searchable and can help you retrieve documents containing an attachment.Attached files that have been physically added to your RSpace server have a solid border. Files that have been added as LINKS and are NOT physically on your server have a dotted line for a border.You can see a list of all attachments in an RSpace document by clicking or tapping the "Files" button at the bottom of the document. Note that currently image files don't appear in that list because technically they are considered part of the document itself.Updating an attachmentAttach a file that you can edit to an RSpace document, as described above. The file is copied to RSpace but the original remains on your local machine..To replace the old attachment with a new one, click the info button, then in the popup, click download > then edit your document in an appropriate application, then in the info popup click "upload new version". You will see the version number of the file increase by 1.You can also highlight the text of the attachment link in the editor, edit the original file on your local computer, then drag and drop the new version onto the target file in RSpace. The link will be updated to the new version and the version number of the file increase by 1.The Info popup will  automatically update with the new version’s properties.The changes to attached files are recorded in the version history of the RSpace document. Select the document with its checkbox in your workspace and click "revisions" to see the revision history and access older versions of attachments.If you are working with attached MS Office files, you may have other options for editing those in your browser.Sharing file attachmentsIn RSpace each user has their own private Gallery of files. You cannot share Gallery files directly with other users. To share Gallery files, you will need to first add them to a document, and then share the document.

If your Lab uses some kind of a shared drive or dedicated server for storing the files, then there is a good chance that you’ll be able to access and link these files from RSpace documents.In RSpace we distinguish between:File System – which is a representation of remote file server or shared drive. Connection between RSpace and various File Systems is configured globally by System Administrator (documentation available at Configuring Institutional File Systems); it is possible to connect through SFTP or Samba (SMB protocol: SMBv1 or SMBv2).Filestore – which is a saved location on a File System, like a bookmark or a shortcut. Filestores are set up individually by users, that’s because each user have usually a different set of locations they want to accessAs an RSpace user you can create a link to one or more Filestore(s), then be able to browse files and insert links from these stores into RSpace documents.Filestores GalleryIf your RSpace is configured to work using institutional Filestores you’ll see additional button in RSpace Gallery. Clicking on the button will open Filestores page, where you can manage and browse your Filestores.Finding Filestores page in the GallerySetting up a new FilestoreTo use institutional File Systems in RSpace you need to create a Filestore first. To create a new Filestore:Navigate to Filestores Gallery and click on ‘Add’ button(only if multiple File Systems are configured) select a File System for your new Filestore(only if not logged in yet) provide your credentials for a given File SystemLogin dialog (if not yet logged in)Browse the file tree and find a folder that should be a starting point for your Filestore, then select its checkboxName your new FilestoreAfter that your Filestore is added in ‘My Filestores’ section:Browsing a FilestoreWhen on a Filestore Gallery page just click on the name of your saved Filestore.Inserting Filestore link into RSpace documentTo insert a link into a document:When editing a document use ‘Insert from Gallery’ button‘Insert from Gallery’Navigate to ‘Filestores’ Gallery and select a Filestore from ‘My Filestores’ list (you can also add a Filestore at this stage, as described in ‘Setting up a new Filestore’ section)Selecting a Filestore(ony if not logged in yet) provide your credentials for a given File SystemLogin dialog (if not yet logged in)browse the file tree to find a file you want to insert, select its checkbox, click on ‘Insert’ buttonThe Filestore link will be added to the document:Filestore link inserted into documentDownloading file from a FilestoreWhen you are viewing a document and you click on a Filestore link, the file will be streamed to your browser so you can save it on your local drive. The file can be also downloaded by clicking on a file name when browsing the Filestore in the Gallery.Clicking on Filestore link downloads the fileDeleting a FilestoreAfter selecting a Filestore click on “Delete” button. That will remove the Filestore from Gallery view, but the links in documents created with this Filestore will still work.Delete Filestore button is active after selecting the FilestoreIn RSpace version 1.83 and higher, it is also possible to link to files stored in the Integrated Rule-Oriented Data System (iRODS), an open source middleware and data storage solution that provides better control and reliabilty for long-term organizational file storage.How did we do?Related ArticlesiRODS IntegrationEgnyte Secure File-store Integration (for Enterprise)The Gallery(opens in a new tab)Powered by HelpDocs(opens in a new tab)×ContactSend

Contact support@researchspace.com if you want to use it on your RSpace Team or Enterprise instance.If your University prefers not to use MS cloud based products, you can offer similar functionality using a product called Collabora OnlineIntroductionRSpace Community is integrated with Microsoft "Office for the web" service to provide best experience when working with Word / Excel / PowerPoint files. Office files uploaded to RSpace can be viewed and edited directly in the browser through fully featured UI provided by Microsoft.Relevant 'Open in Word/Excel/Powerpoint' button will appear in RSpace in various contexts whenever you work with Office-type attachments. For example in notebook view you'll see "Open in Excel" action next to any .xls or .xlsx attachment.You don't need Office 365 license to preview Office attachments, but you need one to to edit them.Required Office 365 licenseEditing office attachments requires Office 365 license covering "Office for the web" component. You'll be asked to authenticate with Microsoft on the first attempt to edit Office attachment. If you have multiple Office accounts (e.g. home and institutional) make sure you log in with the one having a correct license.To check the details of your Office 365 license follow this guide.Viewing RSpace files in Office for the webTo open attachment with Microsoft Office UI click on 'Open in Word / Excel / Powerpoint" action appearing in context menu of RSpace attachment, or in the right hand info panel for Office documents in your Gallery. This will open a new tab in your browser, presenting the document within Microsoft UI.Editing RSpace files through Office for the webEdit action requires Office 365 license covering "Office for the web" component.Select 'Open in Word / Excel / Powerpoint" action in attachment context menu to open the file for viewing, then switch to edit mode using 'Edit in browser' button in Office for the web UI. At this point your Office 365 license will be checked, and Microsoft UI will switch to edit mode."Edit in browser" action will only be available if you have RSpace 'edit' permission for the file, that's if you've uploaded the file yourself, or if the file is attached to the document that is shared with you with 'edit' permission.Any changes applied through Office are saved back to RSpace. After you finish editing switch document back to 'view' mode in Microsoft UI, or just wait for the 'Saving... saved to RSpace" message to appear and close the tab. The new version of the file will be saved in RSpace and a version badge will appear next to the attachment in notebook view.TroubleshootingLicense problemsIf you believe you should be able to edit Office files but you can only view them (and 'Edit' action results in insufficient permissions or some other problem) it may be that your browser stores Microsoft credentials for a wrong Microsoft account.Go to https://login.microsoftonline.com/ and see if that page redirects you to an active account. If it does, sign out of that account (you may need to use 'My Account' -> 'Sign Out'). Open https://login.microsoftonline.com/ again and confirm you're no longer logged in (the browser should show 'Login' or 'Pick an account' page). Go back to RSpace and try editing the document again, after authenticating with a proper account you should be able to edit the file fine.Office gets stuck in a loopIf editing does not work in Safari, with Office getting stuck in a loop after entering account details, try disabling "Prevent cross-site tracking" under Privacy in Safari's settings:A note on privacy and securityWhen using Office integration the opened files are transferred from RSpace to one of public Microsoft servers. All subsequent actions that are done through Office UI are handled by the Microsoft service, not by RSpace. In many cases that's more secure and convenient than alternatives (e.g. downloading the file to your local computer, editing it using your desktop Office application, and uploading edited file back to RSpace), but if you don't want your files to be processed by Microsoft servers, then you shouldn't use the RSpace Office integration.You might consider our integration with Collabora instead.Microsoft Office web servers are not guaranteed to be in any specific geographic location.How did we do?Related ArticlesViewing and Editing Attachments in Collabora Online[Video] Insert Attachments[Video] Update Attachments(opens in a new tab)Powered by HelpDocs(opens in a new tab)×ContactSend

The only restriction is that the file does not exceed the maximum file size set by your RSpace administrator (10Mb by default).To view the original image from within RSpace, you can either download it or view it in the browser.To download an image position the cursor over the bottom right corner of the image. Click on the download icon that appears to download the file, as shown below.An image may be viewed at it’s full-resolution while in the Gallery or in a document/notebook in view mode. This allows you to quickly review intricate data or detailed diagrams without having to download and open the corresponding files.To view an image at it’s full resolution, click on it from within the Gallery or a document/notebook in view mode. This will open the image viewer as shown in the screenshot below. If the image is larger than the ‘preview’ version displayed, a 'magnify' icon will appear when the cursor passes over it. You may click on the magnify icon to view images at full size – you can pan and scroll too.Note: If the image is in TIFF format, this cannot be displayed in a browser. The original image is stored in the filestore and a copy made in PNG format that is scaled to fit in the document page (884px wide maximum).Learn moreInserting ImagesEditing ImagesImage AnnotationHow did we do?Related ArticlesToggle Inventory and Container Views 🧪SnapGene integrationChangelog - what's new?(opens in a new tab)Powered by HelpDocs(opens in a new tab)×ContactSend

To annotate an image, double-click on an image in the text field to open the annotation dialog (tap and hold on tablet/mobile), then use the tools to add text, writing or drawn elements to the image.The original image (located in the Gallery) is unaffected.Image annotations appear on PDF exports.Image annotations are copied when a document is copied.Annotations are made using the Sketcher, already covered in the Sketching. The only difference with an annotation is that there is a background base image rather than a blank canvas. So, a range of drawing and text addition tools are available in the left side of the sketcher window, and to the right, settings can be applied to any objects in the sketch/annotation when selected. Sketching or annotation can be done on a tablet using fingertip tap, swipe and draw gestures, or using a computer mouse.Frequently used figures or fragments of sketches can be added from the saved sketches bar on the far right of the sketcher, and you can even add and adjust existing images from the top level folder of your image gallery, just as you can when Sketching a new image with the sketch tool.

The tools panel on the left allows you to:Undo and redo your changesReset the image to how it was at startCrop (remember to click on "Apply" once you've select the crop area to confirm the changes)Flip horizontally and verticallyRotate (tip: if you wish to rotate by 90 or 180 degrees, use the preset 30 degree rotation buttons until you reach the desired angle)Filter, which allows for a variety of settings such as grayscale, sepia, blur, colour filters and moreIf you're looking to annotate images, this is part of Image Annotation & Sketching.Once you are happy with your edits, click Save as new image on the bottom-right. RSpace will save your image as a separate image, with an "_edited" added to the title. PNGs are saved as PNGs, and JPEGs are saved as JPEGs. The original image remains unchanged.Since JPEGs do not support transparency, saving a rotated JPEG might currently add a black background to the image. If this is problematic, you might wish to convert your images to PNG first before uploading them to RSpace.Link to original imageRSpace keeps a link from the edited image (and any of its derivatives, such as duplicates or edits of the edited image) back to the original image: if you select an image using its checkbox and look at the File Info panel that pops up, there is an "Original Image" section, which indicates the ID of the original image.

This information can be edited in your Profile page, and you can add additional information such as a personal photograph or details about your role or research. Your settings and authentication details remain private to you, but your username, name, affiliation, email, group memberships and any added photo or details are published to a public profile (public within RSpace) which can be found and viewed by other RSpace users. This allows users to find other RSpace users, verify their identity and contact them should they wish to.Searching the Directory for a UserOther users’ profiles are not displayed up front, but can be found by searching for the individual or, if you know their group or PI, locating the group and the list of its members. To search for an individual user, go to My RSpace > Directory, and the default page Users will display. Use the search box in this page to enter a name, username or email to view matching individuals, and select the user you are looking for if they appear in the drop-down, or click 'Go' if you wish to see all matching individuals.The selected user is returned to the page with detail about their full name, affiliation, RSpace username, email and group information. Clicking on the name or username links will open that user’s full public Profile, and they can be contacted by email or internally by sending an RSpace message to their username.Searching the Directory for a GroupIf you know the PI of the group, follow the previous procedure to find the PI’s profile page, then click the link to the group; if you know the group, then simply search for it in the Groups section of the Directory, where all groups appear in a list. Once you have found a group and click on it to view the group page, you can see information about the group, including all of its members, which links to their individual profiles.How did we do?Related ArticlesMy Profile and Authentication[Video] Manage your Profile in RSpaceUsing multiple RSpace accounts with the same SSO identity(opens in a new tab)Powered by HelpDocs(opens in a new tab)×ContactSend

Being in a LabGroup enhances collaboration, through instant sharing of documents with the whole group, or easily accessing individuals in your group.There are three types of Groups in RSpace:1) LabGroups (discussed below) are the most common type of group, especially in Universities, and can be created for any subset of users, by the sysadmin, or, if your server policies allow it, by PIs. A LabGroup must always have a single primary PI (Principal Investigator) who it is assumed is in charge of and overseeing the group's work. In a LabGroup, the PI can automatically see all the work of all the members, except for the work of other group members who have the rank of PI in other LabGroups.2) Collaboration Groups are generally used for formal collaboration between members of two or more different LabGroups with full knowledge and consent of the PIs. Only work shared with the group is visible to all members.3) Project Groups if allowed on your server, allow for more ad-hoc sharing between two or more users without necessarily involving a PI. Only work shared with the group is visible to all members.• In RSpace, access to documents and notebooks is controlled by Group membership. If you don't belong to any Groups, you cannot share anything with anyone, nobody can see your data, and the "Share" button will not appear in your toolbar.• Users can belong to a single LabGroup or to many LabGroups. PIs may lead a single LabGroup, or may lead many LabGroups.• Although a LabGroup can include several users with the role of PI, each LabGroup can only be led by a single PI. If your LabGroup needs more than one main administrator, the PI can promote other users to "LabAdmin with view all permission" also called a senior LabAdmin. The Senior LabAdmins have almost all the same capabilities as the PI.• Your organization can create LabGroups that are arranged as a flat list of non-intersecting sets of users, or concentric nested subgroups, or more complex Venn diagrams. Arrangement of LabGroups allows organizations to control access to data very precisely.• Your server can be configured to allow ONLY the System Admin to create new LabGroups or the server can be configured to allow PIs to make new LabGroups without assistance from the System Admin.• LabGroups can represent permanent associations of scientists who always work together, or they may also represent temporary groupings associated with short-term projects and temporary collaborations. LabGroups can be easily created and dispanded by the System Admin.  You can read about various scenarios for controling data access and segregating data into various types of projects using  different types of groups here.LabGroup RolesRSpace Team and RSpace Enterprise provide an additional role: the System Admin. You can find out more by reading Roles and Capabilities (for Team & Enterprise).Every group member can have one of three roles:PIs have permission to view all documents owned by members of the group and may administer the group’s membership. A PI can create Lab Admins, and therefore delegate some administrative responsibility to other members of their LabGroup. See The PI Role for more.Lab Admins have permission to administer the group (e.g., add/remove group members), but do not by default have the ability to view all content pertaining to the group. See The Lab Admin Role for more.Users do not have permissions to view documents (unless explicitly shared) or administer the group's membership.While being PI of a LabGroup, you can also:Become a user or Lab Admin in other groups created by yourself or other usersBecome PI of more than one group or create new Groups with yourself as PI or Lab AdminInitiate Collaboration Groups in conjunction with other PIsUsers who become PI of a group will acquire a PI role just for their group; their roles in other groups will not be affected. Users can have different roles for each group they are in.Creating a New LabgroupThere are several ways to create LabGroups depending on the server you are using and how it has been configured. For an overview from the System Admin's perspective see here.Viewing a LabGroupIf you are not a PI, your LabGroup page will offer less options than the PI view of the page.Users can easily see information on the members of their LabGroup, group activity, as well as pending invitations and disabled accounts.If you're a PI, you can view the LabGroup page by going into My RSpace > My LabGroups:If you are a member of a LabGroup, you can view the LabGroup page by going to My RSpace > My Profile, and clicking on the relevant group name under LabGroups:You can switch which LabGroup you are viewing by using Change Group on the right-hand side.In the Member's area, you can open a miniprofile by clicking on a user's full name or username. You can then click on Open Profile to view more detailed information about that user.Managing a LabGroupThe LabGroup page is where:Users can leave the group (if on Community) or PIs can remove users (if on Team or Enterprise)PIs can change user roles, view user's work (by clicking on the folder icon next to a user's username), and edit the LabGroup's information. Note that if a user in the LabGroup is a PI of a different group, the PI will not be able to browse that user's documents, to increase privacy.PIs can export an individual user's or the entire LabGroup's work by following Exporting a LabGroup’s WorkGroup Management Permissions TableThe following table summarizes the roles needed to perform various group management actions:Function / RoleUserLab AdminPIAdd and remove users from their groupYYAlter roles of people within their groupYYOrganise content that is shared within the groupYYView content created by group members(Y)*YCreate collaboration groups with other PIsYView and search the audit trail for work performed by group membersYExport and archive the group’s workY*if enabled by PI during LabAdmin assignment, see The Lab Admin Role.Add New Members to a LabGroupYou can invite new members by:Clicking on Invite next to Members in My RSpace > My LabGroups:Type in the names, usernames or emails of users you want to invite and click on the autocomplete suggestions to add them to the list. You can also invite non-RSpace users in the New Users list using their email address, if using RSpace Community. Clicking Invite will send the invitation to all users added to either list; you will be able to see pending invitations on the LabGroup page.New group members automatically see other members’ shared documents.Leaving or Removing a User from a LabGroupIn RSpace Community, a user can remove themselves from a Group, by going into My RSpace > My LabGroups > Leave Group:In RSpace Team and Enterprise, the PI or LabAdmin needs to remove the user by going into My RSpace > My LabGroups and using Remove User action in the Members list:If a user is removed from a group, they will no longer see shared documents. Similarly, deletion of a whole group will unshare all previously shared documents between group members.Sharing with a LabGroupSharing is explained in Sharing Content; if you select Share with Group you will be able to choose which LabGroup to share your document(s) with.

It can be viewed by all users, and is located in the My RSpace tab and accessed using the Directory icon in the scrolling menu.Finding other users using the directory is intuitive: all users can browse or search all of the lists, and there are clickable link elements within each entry which can be used to access further information on that item.In RSpace Community, users are not listed, and have to be searched for. This is to provide some privacy for cloud users by not exposing the entire user list to casual inspection. It is also possible for a user to hide themselves and for PIs/LabAdmins to hide their LabGroup from the Directory and Group listings.UsersIt would be too impractical to display all user as a single list, but all users are known to the system. You locate other users in the Users section of the Directory by searching for any name, username or email address – the search finds options matching what is being typed and you can select from the options at any time and click ‘Go’ to return details about the chosen user. As elsewhere, clickable links allow access to further information about the user, their groups and contact details.LabGroup ListThe LabGroup List shows all LabGroups (but not Collaboration Groups, which remain private), and you can see which Community each group belongs to and can identify and contact its PI. Once again, the list can be searched using the search box, which will again limit the list to entries which match the entered term. Clicking on a Group Name in the list opens a page of information about the group including a list of its members.Communities ListCommunities are the top level administrative unit in RSpace containing a set of LabGroups, and this table displays the current communities by name. This list provides users with access to the Administrator or Administrators of each Community, who can be contacted via their profile.How did we do?Related ArticlesMy Profile, Your RSpace IdentityView and Search the Audit TrailOpen Lab Autosharing(opens in a new tab)Powered by HelpDocs(opens in a new tab)×ContactSend

This makes sharing events more granular and easier to track in the audit trail; it also prevents accidental "over sharing" of large folder trees and prevents the creation of problematic "circular" sharing events.This article goes through various alternatives on how to achieve sharing a folder's contents. You might also be interested in the general documentation on collaboration and sharing.Sharing items into a shared folderYou can share documens into existing shared folders or create a new shared sub-folder and share documents into the new folder in the shared area.You can then edit the shared document in the shared subfolder to make additional content and files immediately available to anyone else with access to that document.Using a document to share Gallery filesIf you wish to share Gallery items, you can create a single RSpace document, and use it like a "container" or folder for any number of files you want to share or bundle together.For example, you can add a list of files from the Gallery to a new document, then share it with a LabGroups or individual. Users the document was shared with will then be able to access all the files that are embedded in the document. This strategy offers a number of advantages and abilities: You can decide who will own the document your shared files are listed in for better management of files.You can add annotations to each file to describe what they are and why they have been shared.You can create a convention for laying out shared files in an organized way, e.g. within an RSpace table with columns for required metadata.You can quickly see when files were added to that document by filtering for the document's unique ID in the audit trail.You can place documents containing shared files into a subfolder named something like "shared files" or you could make multiple subfolders for documents containign different types of files (e.g., "Images" , "Sequences", "Safety Sheets" etc.)You can share the same set of files (embeded in a document) with different LabGroups or individuals, without creating unnecessary duplicates.You have more flexibility to describe the same files differently in different documents so that their signifigance is clear to whoever you share the document with.Using links in document to organise and trace dataWhen you share Gallery files, you are not duplicating them, you are creating LINKS that let other people see and use them in other contexts. You can also create links pointing to other RSpace documents and folders (using the internal link tool), and if the users already have appropriate permissions, they'll be able to access the linked content. This could be useful if you want to let users easily access relevant documents, as you can annotate the links and explain why you are sharing them, and if you feel that simply sharing the documents into a shared folder would not be enough.This can be especially useful in a notebook, where you generally want to tell a succinct narrative story that is not made hard to follow by inserting large blocks of verbose data. By referring to related data using links to Gallery files, documents, folders and other notebooks, you can keep your story easy to follow for your readers, but still make it easy for your audience to locate related data.You will still have to share the documents with the users first, for them to be able to access them.How did we do?Related Articles[Video] Manage Gallery FilesThe Gallery[Video] Moving or Sharing Documents into Notebooks(opens in a new tab)Powered by HelpDocs(opens in a new tab)×ContactSend

This enables streamlined collaboration for groups that want to operate as open labs. Group-wide autosharing, and autoshare management by PIs/Lab Admins with "view all" permissions is available for Team and Enterprise customers. On Community, each user in a group has to enable autosharing of their work themselves.Autosharing works as follows:When you enable autoshare for a specific group, all your current and future documents and notebooks will be shared with that group, with the "read" permission.Your documents will appear in your lab members' Workspaces under Shared > LabGroups > GroupName_SHARED > Folder name you chose when enabling autoshare.As with all RSpace sharing, autosharing creates links to your documents in the Shared folder, where your lab members can access them. They can be thought of as aliases or shortcuts.Sharing does not modify the structure of the original documents in your Workspace. The document links in the Shared folder are organised as a flat list, and PIs/LabAdmins have permissions to re-organise the documents within the Shared folder. This doesn't affect the location of the document in your Workspace.You still can give other lab members the "edit" permissions or unshare items, as described below.Collaboration groups do not allow for any form of autosharing.This article describes autosharing of your own work, and the autosharing management available on RSpace Team and Enterprise. You can read more about sharing at Sharing Content.How to enable autosharing for lab membersAutosharing other group members work and group-wide autosharing are not available on RSpace Community.If these features are disabled on your Team or Enterprise server, please check with your SysAdmin that the group_autosharing.available property is enabled under System > Configuration > System Settings. It does not affect the ability to individually autoshare your own work.On RSpace Team and Enterprise, PIs and LabAdmins with "view all" permissions can:enable autoshare for other non-PI lab membersenable a group wide autoshare statusInstructions on how to enable or disable autosharing for other users and group-wide autosharing, as well as a table summarising autosharing permissions, are included below.Enable or disable autosharing for a user as a PIPIs and LabAdmins with "view all" permissions can manage non-PI members' autoshare status from the LabGroup page, in the Members section of My RSpace > LabGroups. Only the PI themselves can manage their own autoshare status.The toggle indicates the autoshare status of a user: blue if it is enabled, grey if it is disabled. Simply click the toggle to change the autoshare status of a specific user.When enabling, you will have the option to choose a name for the folder the user's work will be shared into. By default, this will be their username. Click on Confirm to enable autosharing.When disabling, you will be asked to Confirm as well.Group-wide autosharingPis and LabAdmins with "view all" permissions can also enable and disable group-wide autosharing for all non-PI members of a LabGroup. When group-wide autosharing is enabled, all new non-PI members joining the lab will have their work autoshared with the group automatically. Individual users' autoshare status can still be modified using the individual toggles, without affecting the group-wide autoshare status.To enable group-wide autosharing, click on Enable Group Autosharing:Then click on Confirm.Autosharing permissions tableNote that SysAdmins cannot change the autoshare status of other users, or manage the group-wide autosharing status.User RoleCan toggle group-wide autosharing?Can toggle autoshare for other group members?Can their work be autoshared by others?UserNoNoYesLab AdminNoNoYesLab Admin with "view all" permissionsYesYesYesPIYesYesNoCommunity AdminNoNoN/ASysAdminNoNoN/AHow to enable autosharing of your own workEveryone can manage their own autoshare status, including on RSpace Community. However, this feature does not apply to Collaboration groups.Navigate to My RSpace > ProfileUnder the LabGroups section, you will find information on the groups you are in, and whether you have autoshare enabled for them. To turn on autosharing, first click on Enable Autosharing.You can optionally provide a name for the folder your work will be shared into, instead of using the default username. For example, you could use your name as a folder name to make it easier for other lab members to identify who the folder belongs to. Then click Confirm to enable autoshare. Note that if you have a large number of documents, you will receive a notification when the process is complete.How to disable autosharing of your own workYou can disable autosharing for groups in the same place, under My RSpace > Profile > LabGroups:Click on Disable Autosharing for the relevant groupClick on Confirm. Note that disabling autosharing will unshare all your work from the group. You will still be able to share individual items with the group using the default sharing mechanism.Use caution if you have moved large numbers of shared items to a range of different locations in the main shared folder. Turning off autosharing removes ALL your autoshared work, regardless of what subfolders or notebooks it was ultimately moved to, so if you often move many autoshared items to new locations, there is a chance you will lose a substantial amount of organizational information.How to set edit permissions for a specific documentNavigate to My RSpace > Shared DocumentsYou will be presented with a full list of all of your shared documents, and who they are shared with. You can use the searchbar on the top-right to find the relevant document, then change the Permission column from READ to EDIT.How to unshare a specific documentNavigate to My RSpace > Shared DocumentsSearch for the relevant item using the top-right searchbar, and click on Unshare in the Options column to unshare it.How to see who is autosharing in your labgroupUnder My RSpace > Profile > LabGroups, click on the labgroup nameIn the members table, you will be able to see who has autosharing enabled and who has not. You can also enable or disable your own autosharing status on this page.How to view your lab members workIn the Workspace, click on the Shared folder, then LabGroups, then the name of your group. You will find folders for each lab member that has enabled autoshare. These folders contain all the contents of their Workspace. Note that shared files will be returned in normal search results, so you can use the searchbar to look for specific files.How did we do?Related ArticlesRoles and Capabilities (for Team & Enterprise)The WorkspaceLong-term Data Management(opens in a new tab)Powered by HelpDocs(opens in a new tab)×ContactSend

This article covers sharing of:DocumentsNotebooksFolders and Gallery itemsThe Shared FolderAll users who belong to at least one LabGroup can access the main shared folder and various sharing sub-folders, where shared content can be found. To allow others to access your work, you have to share content, and in the case of sharing with a LabGroup, Collaboration Group or Project Group, you can also specify where the content should be placed inside the Shared LabGroup folder. New work cannot be created directly inside a shared location nor can it simply be moved to a shared folder. In RSpace, all work must first be created by a single individual called the Owner, and then shared into a shared folder. When you share an RSpace document, or Notebook, a new link (also sometimes called a shortcut or alias) is created in the appropriate shared folder, where the document and any attached files within that document can now be accessed by other users. Sharing a document has no affect on the location of the "original" link in the owner's workspace.This allows everyone in your LabGroup to see the same view when looking in the Shared folder, while each individual can organise their documents in the Workspace however they want without affecting the organisation of items the Shared folder. This approach is flexible, adaptable and has many advantages:• Ensures documents can be created privately, and then shared manually or automatically, preventing accidental sharing but also alllowing real-time managed access as needed.• Allows the same work to exist in different organizational contexts so that the owner can organize it one way in their own workspace, but the same work may be organized differently in its shared context.• Allows work to be shared with different permissions for different groups or individuals.• Establishes in all cases who is the unambiguous Owner of the work, and allows the Owner to have good control over the work, even if it is deleted from its shared context.• Pre-determines the fate of the work in situations where LabGroups change or disband, or where group members leave, or stop using RSpace.• Helps to prevent ownership disputes, data misplacement, and privacy problems.PIs and LabAdmins can organise the Shared folder of their LabGroup by moving Documents and creating folders. Members of the LabGroup can create folders, as well as select a specific folder to share a Document into, but do not have permissions to organise items within the Shared folder.Note that by default, PIs and LabAdmins with view permission (also called senior LabAdmins) can directly view the workspace of users in thier LabGroup even if the user has not explicitly shared the work.Shared folders can be located in one of three ways:1) Navigate to the last page of the workspace. At the bottom of the page, click on the "Shared" folder. This folder contains up to 4 subfolders containing the shared folders for groups (LabGroups, Collaboration Groups or Project Groups) and individual collaborations you belong to.2) Click the "LabGroup Records" icon on the workspace toolbar to jump directly to the Shared / LabGroups folder. Click a LabGroup to see the shared content, or navigate up one level to see other types of Groups.3) From My RSpace > My profile, click on the name of any group you belong to, then on the group details page, click the icon for the shared folder to go directly to the list of shared items.You can view more in-depth examples of how to structure sharing at Examples of Sharing Scenarios and Project Organisation.Sharing a Document or NotebookYou can select one or more documents, and they can be shared with groups (LabGroups, Collaboration Groups or Project Groups) or individuals in your groups, or in the case of Community Edition, individuals not yet using RSpace using their email address. Different types of Group can be used to support different types of collaboration or access.When you share a document, all the content "goes along for the ride" including any attached files within that document.The document sharing process is applicable to Notebooks as well, but permission handling for Notebooks is slightly different (see permissions within shared notebooks).To share a document:In the Workspace view, select the checkbox of one or more documentsIn the context menu that appears, click ShareYou can now select who you want to share with. Click on a category (as shown in screenshot) to define who to share with and the permissions they will have. You can define sharing across the three categories, and your choices will all be applied when you click on Share.For Share with Group, select the relevant group. You can then define permissions (either read or edit) and which folder or notebook to share into (optional). If you do not select a folder/notebook to share into, the Document will be placed at the top-level of the Shared folder. Sharing with multiple groups will require you to go through the process several times.For Share with Users, you can share documents with individual users that are in the same group(s) as you. This is useful if you don’t want to share your document with all the members of a group.In Share with Others, you can share documents with users who are not in the same groups as you. If you are using Community, you can invite not yet registered users. Start typing a user's name, username or email and RSpace will auto-suggest matching users. The users will be sent an email invite, and the sharing occurs once the invitation is accepted. Non-RSpace users will have to sign up before they can see your document.In RSpace Community, users can share documents with any other Community edition user, or even invite totally new users to use RSpace using "Share with Others". For RSpace Enterprise and RSpace Team Edition, sharing is limited to other users on your server and the option to Share with Others is not available. For Teams and Enterprise Editions you can use the Publish feature to make data available to colleagues who do not use RSpace.Click on Share. This will immediately share the selected document(s) with the selected groups and/or users, with the specific read/edit permissions across the three sections.Depending on what settings the user(s) you have shared with have enabled (see My Profile and Authentication), they will get a email notification and/or an RSpace notification.AutosharingIf your System Admin has enabled it, users can also choose to automatically choose to share all of their work with selected groups, or the LabGroup PI may enforce this option so that the work of all members of a lab is automatically available to everyone in that lab. For details see: Autosharing.Viewing a Shared DocumentShared documents will appear in the main Workspace, under the Shared folder. The Shared folder contains a folder named IndividualShareItems, CollaborationGroups, and LabGroups for documents shared with individuals, Collaboration Groups and LabGroups. For example, a document shared with TestGroup will be found by navigating to Shared / LabGroups / TestGroup_SHARED.Shared documents will have an icon indicating that they are shared:You can use the Shared with me filter in the Workspace toolbar options to view shared documents.You can also search for a specific shared document like you would normally, or use Advanced Searching to filter documents by owner.More details are provided at Viewing and Organising Shared Group Content.Editing a Shared DocumentEach RSpace document can be edited by one user at a time. When a user starts editing the document, no other users can edit it until the user doing the editing saves and closes the document, or when their session expires. When editing, new content is periodically autosaved.A shared document can be viewed by any number of users simultaneously. If a document is updated, this will not refresh another user's view page. However, if the user decides to edit, the page will refresh and open the editor with the most recent version of the document.View Sharing Information of a DocumentTo view the owner and sharing information of a document:Click on the File Info Button of a documentYou will be able to see the owner and with which groups and permissions the document has been shared in the info panel.Unsharing or Editing Permissions of a Shared DocumentNavigate to My RSpaceSelect Shared Documents (you will have to use the arrow on the right side to see it)You can see a list of your shared documents, including who they are shared with and the permissions applied. You can also see your shared document requests at the bottom. You can use the Permissions dropdown on the right to edit permissions, or click on Unshare to unshare the document. It's not a bad idea to re-visit this area periodically to review what work you are sharing with your colleagues and make any changes you like if your collaboration needs have changed.Determining which Users or Groups have access to an RSpace DocumentFor a given document you can click the blue info button to see a list of which users or groups that document has been shared with:To see a list of specific individuals who have at least "read" acceess to a document, type an "@" in the body of the document while in edit mode. A list will automatically appear that includes anyone who can see the document.Sharing a Folder or Content from the GalleryIt is not possible to directly share a folder from the Workspace or files the Gallery with other users. However, one can share LINKS to folders or collections of files from the Gallery using alternative methods described in Sharing Folder or Gallery Contents. The easiest way to share one or more files with users is to insert those files into a basic document, add some annotations (e.g., what the files are and why you are sharing them) and then share the document. This immediately makes those files available to the recipient.Learn More About Various Sharing Scenarios for Individuals, Projects and LabGroupsIf you are PI you will probably want to read about some examples of various ways to share data, segregate data into projects and set up appropriate ownership of shared work.We also recommend that PIs take a moment to learn more about different types of LabGroups and understand how to see and manage shared work belonging to users who have left your organization (e.g., students who have graduated.How did we do?Related ArticlesThe WorkspaceNotebooksViewing and Organising Shared Group Content(opens in a new tab)Powered by HelpDocs(opens in a new tab)×ContactSend

If your RSpace doesn't have it, ask your System Admin to upgrade and enable the feature.OverviewThere are three types of Groups in RSpace:LabGroups are the most common type of group, especially in universities, and can be created for any subset of users, by the sysadmin, or if your server policies allow it, by PIs. A LabGroup must always have a single primary PI (Principal Investigator) who it is assumed is in charge of and overseeing the group's work. In a LabGroup, the PI can automatically see all the work of all the members, exacept for the work of other group members who have the rank of PI in other LabGroups.Collaboration Groups are generally used for formal collaboration between members of two or more different LabGroups with full knowledge and consent of the PIs. Only work shared with the group is visible to all members.Project Groups (if enabled on your server), allow for ad-hoc sharing between two or more users without necessarily involving a PI. Only work shared with the group is visible to all members.System Administrators must enable this feature on your RSpace instance. The system property allow_project_groups is initially DENIED and must set to be ALLOWED.Project Groups are designed to allow selective and precise collaboration between users without exposing any unshared work to other Project Group members or their respective PIs. Such groups don't need a PI, and if the user with global PI role joins the Project Group they are treated as a regular user. No member of the project group has access to content of other members until that content is shared with the group. Your RSpace System Admin may choose to dissallow the use of Project Groups if your organization's policies prevent sharing between users without explicit consent and oversight by a PI.Users can start Project Group themselves, or such group can be created by System Admin. User who started the Project Group is called the Group Owner. Group owner can invite other users to join a Project Group, remove the current members from the group, or assign Group Owner role to others.Creating a Project GroupIf Project Groups are allowed by the System Admin, you should see Create Project Group option in My RSpace tab.Click on Create Project Group, then on Create Group button.Enter a name for the new group, click Next.You can invite group members at this stage, or later. Click Next.On final screen review the details, and click on 'Create Project Group'.Accepting an Invitation to a Project GroupTo accept an invitation to join a Project Group, click "Accept" on the invitation panelLeaving a Project GroupAt any time, a participating user can leave a Project Group by clicking "Leave Group".Managing a Project GroupProject Groups are managed by one or multiple Group Owner(s). The creator of the Project Group is given the Group Owner role. Project Groups can have multiple Group Owners.Group Owners can:Change the role of other group members to Group OwnerChange the role of Group Owners to UserRemove members from the groupRename the groupDelete the groupGroup owners cannot:Remove the last group ownerLeave the group if they are the only group ownerChange the last group owner's role to UserCreation of a Project Group by the System AdminSystem admins can create Project Groups using the exact same procedure as any other user (described above). There is no special mechanism for this in the System Administrator's "System Tab". After creating a Project Group with themselves as the Group Owner, the System Admin will typically need to change the Group Owner to one of the other members, and then leave the group.How did we do?Related ArticlesExamples of Sharing Scenarios and Project OrganizationCreating and Managing LabGroups (for System Admins)General Information on LabGroups(opens in a new tab)Powered by HelpDocs(opens in a new tab)×ContactSend

You can then send a ‘review record’ request to yourself with a time/date that you can subsequently download to your calendar app as a .ics file.You can then manage this request in the same way as any other – just remembering that you are both the sender and the recipient! So, as the sender, you can Cancel the request from the SentMessages section of  the Messaging tab, and as the Recipient you can set as completed once you’re done.How did we do?Related ArticlesIntegrations List & AvailabilityEdit Quantities in Lists of Materials 🧪Using Inventory Lists of Materials in the ELN 🧪(opens in a new tab)Powered by HelpDocs(opens in a new tab)×ContactSend

You can include an industry standard .ics calendar file in this type of message which allows for simple task assignment on your system calendar.Mentions are a fast way to send a notification to another user to draw their attention to a document or a portion of a document.Communication is a general term referring to any of the above types.Messages and notifications can be viewed either in the dedicated ‘Messaging’ section, accessed from the Messages tab in the application header, or via the message icons which appear in the toolbar on some pages when a message or notification has been received.NotificationsA user can opt to receive notifications about particular events that may interest them, such as someone sharing a document with them. Then the system will post them a notification each time the event occurs.To do this, go to My RSpace>My Profile, navigate to the ‘Message settings’ section in the Profile page,  and select the checkboxes on the left.This list of actions may be added to in future releases; currently you can elect to receive notifications about documents:when someone shares a document with you, when a document you can edit is edited by someone else, when a document that is shared with you has been unshared and when a request state changes; and about background processes: when a process finishes and when a process fails.Currently, for notifications to work, a group needs to be set up, and each user in the group needs to opt in to receive the notifications. An icon appears in the toolbar when  you have new notifications:Clicking on the icon opens a pop-up containing a list of new notifications, with links to the relevant document when appropriate. Notifications are paginated and can be ordered by time or by user. Notifications can be dismissed individually, per page, or all at once. Any notifications not dismissed can be viewed at any time by returning to the main Messaging tab and choosing the My Notifications section.MessagesSimple messages can be sent between RSpace users internally within the system. A message is sent when the ‘Basic message’ type is chosen as the request type. When new messages are received, they appear as envelope and downward arrow icons in the Workspace toolbar, with a number indicating the amount of new, unread messages. When this image is clicked, a list of messages appears in a pop-up dialog:Messages can be replied to or dismissed within this dialog, or can be revisited later in the main Messaging tab.Freeform messages can be sent to any user on the system from the ‘Create Message’ button (the envelope icon)  in the Workspace toolbar, or from the equivalent icon at the top of the Messaging main page. In the dialog, use the autocomplete to find your intended recipient (type a name, username or email address and select the user when they appear in the drop-down list) and enter your message in the space below.The following table describes the permitted content that can be added to messages:Entered contentRendered contentCommentsExample inputExample outputPlain textPlain text, identicalThis was the only content handled in  1.33Hi, this is a messageHi, this is a messageText with URLsURLs are converted to clickable linksUser can paste in links without authoring any HTML Hi, have a look at https://community.researchspace.com/globalId/SD32800Hi, have a look at https://community.researchspace.com/globalId/SD32800Text with basic HTML markup drawn from a, b, blockquote, br, cite, code, dd, dl, dt, em, i, li, ol, p, pre, q, small, strike, strong, sub, sup, u, ulFormatted HTML (not escaped)Simple HTML that cannot be misused is allowed, other tags such as block-level tags and script tags will be removedHi you <strong> must </strong>read <a href=”http://www.bbc.co.uk”>this</a>Hi you must read thisMalicious HTMLRemovedTo prevent CSS attacksHi this could execute any javascript! <script>alert(1);</script>Hi this could execute any javascript!RequestsRequests are a specialized form of message that require an action to be performed by  its recipients. Optionally, they can be assigned a completion date, i.e. when you want the task done by.Requests appear in the message listing. The recipient of the request can update its status; accepting, rejecting, or marking it completed, along with an optional comment. If the request has a completion date assigned to it, then they can download a .ics file to their default calendar by clicking on the calendar icon. We would be interested to hear about further requirements for integration into lab workflow or calendar systems.A sender of a request can keep track of the requests they’ve made in the Messaging section of RSpace, and can cancel the request if no longer required.MentionsMentions are a fast way to send a notification to another user to draw their attention to a document or a portion of a document. are a fast way to send a notification to another user to draw their attention to a document or a portion of a document.

ChemicalYou can also search by chemical structures, using ChemAxon’s structure search feature. Read more about searching by chemical structures in our ChemAxon Integration article.Searching within recordsIf you select one or more Folders/Notebooks/Documents from the Workspace listing (using the checkbox on the left end of an entry) and perform a search, you will be given the option to restrict results to selected items, which will restrict the search to the currently selected items and all their descendants. You can remove parts of your selection, by clicking on the cross next to an item in the panel. You also have an option to ignore the selection with the 'Search Everywhere' option.Workspace Advanced SearchAdvanced search essentially allows you to build more complex and fine-grained searches by adding more than one pair of filter and term sets, and the combination of all filters and terms are used to produce the results. So, for example, you can search for all documents produced by a particular user, and also search within a set date range.To use advanced search:Click on the hamburger (triple line) icon on the right side of the searchbar:This will open the advanced search panel. You can add more conditions using the + icon next to the last condition.It is possible to further control your results by using ‘Satisfy all conditions’ ('AND' operation) or ‘Satisfy at least one condition’ ('OR' operation) in your combinations.Finally, you can remove a condition by clicking on the rubbish bin icon next to it.The available options in the advanced search filters are:TextTagNameFormTemplateCreation dateLast modifiedOwnerAttachmentWithin recordsA few things to note:The semantics of individual sub-queries is the same as the Workspace simple search, searching over all files/folders visible to you, wherever you are in your folder tree.Advanced search by Text, Tag, Name, Form, Last Modified and Owner retrieve the same results as using simple search. In other words, performing an ‘Advanced Search’ with only a single search clause retrieves exactly the same results as when performed in the ‘Simple Search’.Search within recordsThis additional option in the advanced search filter, 'Within records', allows you to restrict results of a search to selected items and all their descendants.If you had one or more Folders/Notebooks/Documents selected in the Workspace listing (using the checkbox on the left end of an entry), the selection will appear when you select the Within records filter:You can click the cross icon next to an item to remove it from the selection, or use the folder icon on the right of the selection to select more items:Clicking on the folder will open a selection panel:As with other filters in the Advanced Search, Within records can be combined with other filters to produce more fine-grained searches.Notebook SearchThis is the search capability available in the Notebook – it is essentially a “All” option to search over the contents of entries in the Notebook.Expert Lucene Query SyntaxIf you’re familiar with Lucene search syntax, you can run powerful queries from a single input field, by prefixing your query with l:. Learn more about the Lucene query language here.Searching everything using luceneTo find text anywhere in the RSpace ELN, choose the 'All' parameter from the dropdown if it is not already selected by default, then enter your lucene query. For example, to find items that contain the text strings 'DNA' and 'RNA' but not 'chemical' , enterl: DNA AND RNA NOT chemicalThe results will include all documents and indexed attached files that meet the search criteria.Searching using a single search parameter from the dropdownTo find text specifically within the text of RSpace documents, choose ‘Text’ in the main search parameter dropdown, then, to look for e.g. the words ‘rna’ AND ‘pcr’, enter: l: rna AND pcrTo search for items in the ELN where the name of the item contains specific text, but you want to ignore the text in the body of RSpace documents or attached files, first select the 'Name' parameter in the dropdown, then to look for items where the name of the contains e.g. EITHER 'algae' or 'plant' enter: l: algae OR plantNote that in this case, the reults could include both RSpace documents and attached files with the target text in their name.To limit your search to text located within attached files, select the 'Attachment' parameter in the dropdown, then enter e.g. l: eppendorf AND tubeThe results will only show attached files that contain BOTH of these text strings.Not all search parameters in the drop down menu support this type of search. You can only use lucene queries with one of: 'All' , 'Text' , 'Name', 'Form' , 'Template' or 'Attachment' parameters selected from the search parameter dropdown.Specifying one or more search parameters in the main search areaYou can use lucene queries in the main search areas of both the ELN and the RSINV inventory system to specify which search parameter or parameters you want to use in the lucene query itself and build queries that look at more than one parameter.Supported parameter names for this type of search are as follows:fields.fieldData – Text within the body of RSpace documentsdocTag – tagsformName – form namename – the name of an RSpace document, attached file or folderowner.username – username of the ownerFor example, suppose you want to search for records created by users with the RSpace username 'Bob' or 'Anna'. You do not need to pick the "owner" parameter from the dropdown, but instead, choose "All" if it is not already selected by default, then enter:l:(owner.username:bob OR owner.username:anna)The parentheses are important to ensure the precedence of the OR/AND operators.Now suppose you want to search for records created by Bob or Anna, that are tagged with either ‘project’ or ‘project2’. In this case, we need to search across both users and tags, so you need to add the name of the paramater you want to search, and the values you are searching for.l: (owner.username:bob OR owner.username:anna) AND (docTag:project OR docTag:project2)Again, the parentheses are important to ensure the precedence of the OR/AND operators.In another example, suppose you want to locate documents that are tagged with either 'hepatic' or 'tissue=liver' , or which contain the word 'liver' in the document name. Enter:l:(docTag:hepatic OR docTag:tissue=liver) OR (name:liver)Tip: If you are creating quite a long lucene query with multiple parts, it's best to edit this in a text editor outside of RSpace first, then copy and paste the query into the RSpace search box once you are sure it is typed correctly. Basic lucene searches are also supported in the inventory system. Although our roadmap includes plan for a unified system-wide search that will return results from both ELN and inventory modules, as of version v1.88.0 the two modules have separate search tools. Inventory items do not appear in results for searches performed in the ELN workspace, and ELN items do not appear in the inventory search.Lucene search in the RSINV Inventory SystemFor general information about searching for items in the RSINV inventory system click here.You can use lucene queries in the search area of the navigation panel in the RSINV inventory system. You can specify which search parameter or parameters you want to use in the lucene query itself and build boolean queries that combine multiple parameters.Unlike the ELN search ALL parameter-value quries MUST be enclosed in parentheses in the inventory sysem even if you only use a single query.Supported parameter names for this type of search in the RSINV inventory system are as follows:fields.fieldData – Text within inventory item 'custom fields'tags – text within the 'Tags' field of inventory itemsname – the name of an inventory itemdescription - text in the "Description" field of inventory itemsowner.username – username of the inventory item ownerExamples:To find items that must include BOTH of the tags 'peptide' and 'parkinsons':l: (tags:peptide AND tags:parkinsons)To find an item that includes the word 'algae' in the 'description' field of a sample:l: (description:algae) Note the parentheses. For lucene searches based on specific parameters in the inventory system, these must always be included even for simple searches involving a single parameter and valueTo find items owned by user 'rdprincipal' that must include EITHER the tags 'peptide' OR 'parkinsons' AND also must have the exact text: 'peptide sample new' in the name, but must not include the tag 'contaminated'.l:(owner.username:rdprincipal) AND (tags:peptide OR tags:parkinsons) AND (name:"peptide sample new") NOT (tags:contaminated)If you want to search across all materials you have access to, be sure to remove any extra filters from the current RSINV search, as these will interfere with your lucene search. For example if you leave the 'Bench Owner' filter in place, you will be limiting your lucene search to items on your benchYou may be able use other advanced lucene features like wildcard searches, fuzzy searches proximity searches, range searches and more. Not all of these features are tested, so you may need to experiment a little. For more details on Lucene syntax, please look at this reference documentation: http://lucene.apache.org/core/2_9_4/queryparsersyntax.htmlOrdering and sorting resultsBy default, results are ordered by name and sorted DESC (descending).Order by name / Sort DESC (descending):0 – 9A – Za – zOrder by name / Sort ASC (ascending):z – aZ – A9 – 0The column headers that can also be used as ordering criteria are indicated by being blue ‘clickable’ links. You can change the column to use for sorting by clicking the link headers. In the following image, Name, Created and Modified are clickable:The current column being used for the display order will have an ‘Order’ icon made of up and down arrows:You can toggle the results order using the up/down icon (or just by clicking the column name again)– the icon will offer the alternative order to the current one and change the listing to that if clicked. That is, clicking on Modified once will sort the entries by Modified (Descending), and clicking again will sort by Modified (Ascending).By default, Workspace records are ordered by Modified (Descending).Showing more results per pageYou can change the number of records per page using the Items per page option on the bottom-left of the Workspace, and you can navigate through the results using the numbered links:How did we do?Related ArticlesSearch BasicsSystem Wide Search  (for System Admins)Viewing and Organising Shared Group Content(opens in a new tab)Powered by HelpDocs(opens in a new tab)×ContactSend
